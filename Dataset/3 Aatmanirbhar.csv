0," Not an Indian, but I am pretty familiar with semiconductor manufacturing. There are only a few regions of the world which have this expertise: USA, Israel, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, Best Korea, and China (which has been trying for 20 years is is still about 2 generations behind).  Need very advanced talent in semiconductor related disciplines as well as an entire ecosystem of advanced tool manufacturers and advanced construction industry.  2) Stable electricity grid and access to large volumes of clean municipal water ( the water used in semiconductor manufacturing is even cleaner than used for heart surgery). All of this can be arranged in India for sufficient cost and time.  3) Very good road/rail infrastructure and ports - every plant in the world competes with each other, it's a cut throat business and the sorts of delays caused by logistics will kill margins for a factory in India.  The Chinese semiconductor industry has been unprofitable for close to 20 years and has been heavily subsidized by the Chinese government - they realize creating an advanced industry like this won't happen in an instant. Is the Indian government willing to put in billions of USD per year into growing this industry?  In my opinion, India has missed the train (and so has China). Companies like Intel and TSMC have become so advanced with their manufacturing process that on a profit margin basis, no one can compete with their fabs. In 20 years time an Intel fab in the USA might have a few process technicians and engineers and the rest will be fully automated. Most of these plants are already at 85% automation. In this scenario the only benefit Indian plants will have is the low cost of electricity and water.  I think a nation like India should focus on providing  clean water,sanitation, medical services, education, and electricity to its people. For example, countries like Iran or Mexico. They are as rich as China and they have very few advanced industries, but what they do have for 90%+ of people is access to clean water, sanitation, medical services, education, and electricity.  I have seen how Mexico is rapidly showing signs of growing wealthier - many car factories and  even tech companies tapping into their potential because they see Mexico has the basic necessities in place.  Focus on the basics and India will immediately be 5-10x richer. Stop worrying about lofty goals like semiconductor fabs."

2," Good post. I think indians have a severe case of ""keeping up with the Joneses"" China did X, therefore we must do X. With little consideration of ground realities. India needs to invest in getting the basics right before going after expensive propositions like semiconductor manufacturing. A good start would be start making our own weapons. Indian army still lacks a good assault rifle. Even imports are stuck in deals and bureaucratic nagging"
3, TSMC is building 5nm Fabrication plant in USA. So india has missed the train...
4," Thanks for sharing your detailed analysis. Making notes out of it.Also it is acceptable at the moment that India missed the train but currently, we have not done anything.  We have to start somewhere."
5, Fax!
6, Yupp.
7, All of this requires visionary people leading the country in the best interests of its people not just 'his' people.
8, Reliable access to semiconductors is key to national security though. You can see Trump causing TSMC to consider setting up a fab in Arizona. It might go the Foxconn way but I think the US might be more motivated to bring key supply chains out of the Taiwan strait.
9," Man I have seen how precise the laser had to hit those metal balls to convert it into plasma for semiconductor design, I have to say even isro doesn't practice that level of precision In their work"
10," Nah. I disagree and clearly ignorant of India's scale of population. India doesn't have enough money to ensure all that for 1.4 billion people. iran and Mexico have a fraction of India's population. The only way to lift people out of poverty truly would require creating stable employment and the only way to do that is having manufacturing shift in India, the only real example for India to follow is China considering it has the same population. Semiconductor manufacturing is not the only type of manufacturing anyway, we should start from the bott and build our way up."
11," China already produces 16 percent of needed chips, and sooner or later they'll get there; especially now, because of the Huawei and US thing. And India also can.  Why not? I mean, we could land on Mars, but oh no we can't compete in the semiconductor industry, which so many countries have already done and are doing. If small countries like Taiwan and Malaysia and South Korea can do it, then so can India. It'd take time and of course better governance than the current lot, but you talk as if you're still living in colonial times."
12," fix roads, airports. fix electricity generation Get decently educated people. The rest would follow. We are still stuck at #1"
14, Atmanirbhar Bharat is a fucking joke. Make in India is a fucking joke. Everything is a fucking PR Drivel to sell to the WhatsApp forwarding retards.

18," Hey, Please share your knowledge about the semiconductor fabrication and problems wrt India.Lot of things which you consider as basic are not know to the majority of the people Let the conversation begin and exchange ideas."
19," As others have already pointed out, it's just unfeasible for India to set these up. But what actually infuriates me is the import fee on things that aren't manufactured in India and never will be. Take Graphics Cards for example, it's bullshit how much you need to pay extra on the MRP just to get your hands on one."
20, Indian AMD kek.
1, infrastructure to support WD toshiba or micron Fab Can you please share the details about the infrastructure requirements?
1," Yes, India can start by building the necessary infrastructure including a very strong approach towards reducing corruption and bureaucracy. Give a village electricity, clean water, and a school and people will start to dream of more than just getting by."
1," "" India doesn't have enough money to ensure all that for 1.4 billion people"".  Yes, it does. We are living in a world of negative interest rates for starters. And China has done this too. India also has such a low cost of labor. This needs to be abused! China's path toward becoming a middle income nation was bought almost entirely with debt, the same journey that countless nations have undertaken.  Also, India's population is so concentrated that the $/person served for basic utilities like power and water is actually much lower than a place like the USA or Iran.  ""The only way to lift people out of poverty truly would require creating stable employment and the only way to do that is having manufacturing shift in India "". Manufacturing shifts don't happen because the government says ""OK folks, lets build cars and rockets, and semiconductors"". They happen after a decades long push involving the build out of critical infrastructure.  You cannot skip steps 3-9 and somehow arrive at step 10."
2, wealth is endogenous with population. small population doesn't mean more wealth.
3, The only way to lift people out of poverty truly would require creating stable employment and the only way to do that is having manufacturing shift in India Well said. Very few industries can employ unskilled labors and manufacturing is one of them.
1," But states like MH, Delhi have zero problems. This is just not true. MH =/= Mumbai. I lived in Raigad district for a few months a year or so ago and there were regular power cuts. Pune's industrial areas close on Thursdays because they have power cut the entire day. I've seen the south work its way out of power cuts but for many parts of India, 3-4 hours of power cuts everyday is still a way of life. Dhoni's wife was complaining last year about 7-8 hours daily power cuts in Ranchi - a state capital. I live in Odisha and we have about 4 hours of power cuts everyday. On for 10 mins, gone for 5. If our generation and distribution is so good, why are a majority of our population still living with spotty power?"

3,"Rare earth elements are mined only by china for now. The fab plants are in taiwan and other SE countries. NOTHING OF THIS Is GOING TO COME TO INDIA. Modi and his ilk are not even sleeping, but dreaming."
4,Which rare earth element are you talking about? I like chemistry and have experience with MES so am interested.
5,Which elements are required for the manufacturing process?Can we extract them from e-Waste generated and imported in India?
6,Atmanirbhar India only needs PR and whatsapp forwards to be a success.
7,There are plenty of other higher priority things that India needs over a fab IMO
8,You have very valid point there. Majority of people here are busy criticising  and mocking the govt with no solution to offer. Not saying one should stop criticising but someone should look for solutions as well. Present govt does lot of PR but poor execution. That’s why aatma nirbhar became meme. I believe if India becomes self reliant with strong manufacturing setup will solve lot of issues.
9,So Govt. can't think of a solution ? I thought it is their job.
10,Govt doesnt give solution and doesn't need to. They should just focus on creating a platform where people can come with solutions. First comments sums up it perfectly.
11,"We, the people of India, need/deserve solutions to all of our problems. Ideally, solutions should come from Govt. But current govt and opposition parties are incompetent in finding any solution. Nobody is stopping the people of India to find solutions themselves. Keep criticizing and pressuring the govt. However, when we come up with solutions as well, it will expose their incompetency completely."

30,Hoping to hear more from https://www.hsmcindia.com . Apparently started by some Indian expats to do just this.
33,"fabrication plants and rare earth mineral mining are two different things. the fabs require very very sterile/clean spaces. almost like bio-hazard labs. the engineering required to design the chips is an entirely different process. india has lots of vlsi engineers, but lot of them are in US. mining comes with its own hazards. Not sure if we have places with ore within our country. The e-waste extraction is hazardous process, we have no safety mechanisms even today. Many kids are involved in this, and get poisoned over long term, much like working in the marble mines of rajasthan. we can do it, if there is a special team to do in-depth study, get all the required apparatus etc. Is there money in it? maybe. Labour, only construction. most of the fab plants are automated, so little on-going employment. we are not yet that high up the value chain of many things. no planning, no goals, no dedicated teams."

55,Semiconductor fab requires equipment that needs billions of dollars and is very very costly. Plus the pace at which developments are made in the semiconductor industry is very fast. If you do not innovate and reach a lower technology node your competitors have outdone you. So keeping up and updating current technology also requires even more amount of money. This is simply too expensive for even rich people to undertake. Even if the govt undertakes with so much money if they don't keep up with new tech they lose the game.

0," [Against] The world is globalized now, there’s no going back from that. We are all dependent on each other for services, commodities and skilled labour. This introduces efficiency that lowers costs and increases profits and performance of companies that work hard to build a global presence. Cutting ourselves off from that will not make us stronger or more independent. You also need to ask what your vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ is. If it’s going back to the pre-1991 isolated economy, it’s too high a cost. I would rather we have fewer geopolitical options due to globalization than have zero options due to poverty."
1," most of people here think that isolation would lead to us becoming superpower,  actually it would lead us to pre 1991"
2," True, however one has to realize that India's Atmanirbhar effort is only for those where there are sanctions that can cripple economy. They are not against importing but if they develop industry they can increase employment and there by taxes too, agrarian economy with exports is also coming, pharma is already there, defense is in the pipeline. Many people don't recognize the soul of India, which is karma bhoomi which maps to Live and let live, unlike other nations that deal on death and misery. Many people don't understand this fine line and speaks in black and white. if you look at history we exported culture and not fear, we didn't export stealing of nations wealth unlike colonialists. This whole argument requires finer thinking rather than just highlevel look. We were global before others were global."
3, !delta
4, !kudos
5," [against] The same is the case with manufacturing. So while the service sector is a large segment, it's just one variable in a multivariate equation. Truth is, one cannot be completely 'atmnirbhar' - countries will always be dependent on others for the (geographically) lacking resources. Another way to make India more atmnirbhar (and I'm just focusing on my own relative expertise in this domain here) is to develop better, bigger and more robust supply chains within the country so that imports from other countries aren't necessarily a cheaper alternative - thus not only reducing imports, but also supporting local businesses."
6," Key sector where becoming aatmanirbhar is the only option. [For] Semiconductors: This needs no explanation the whole world can't rely on Taiwan. Defence and Aerospace : Indian startups have a huge market since government import majority of our equipment. And in Coming decades space exploration will boom if we start working now we will be in a better position. New technologies like quantum computing, blockchain, artificial intelligence have huge potential and can be game changer for our economy. EV and renewable energy: We should not be reliant on fossil fuels for or energy consumption. But of course we will have to import many goods and services and raw material but India being such a large country should not choke due supply chain issue. Coming conflicts will make globalisation obsolete."
7," All of this would require heavy Investment in Education and R&D, we need to have a robust Education system to encourage Innovation! political will is the major hindrance in all this! All the legal procedures slow down the budding businesses. A reform is needed in the Ease of Doing Business space."
8," Globalization wont get obsolete but will shoot through roof , this fast few years will be forgotten in just a decade , and as iot increases together with a more mature financial market rich countries will increase foreign trade"
10," Against - We can’t be self reliant until electric vehicle become mainstream and we no longer have to rely on imports. Until then we need to rely on goods and services exports and remittances for foreign exchange, which can be used for paying for imports. Railway electrification and metro systems are helping here. And we are still lower middle income country, so poverty will shoot up in case of sanctions. To become upper middle income country we badly need software exports, which will stop drainage of our foreign exchange reserves. India goods exports consist of raw material imports, we even export refined oil which is fully import dependent. While software export needs almost zero imports, except some laptop/pc chips which we would need for other purposes anyway Russia isn’t affected by sanctions because they don’t have to import oil, and also they were developed country above upper middle income level before the start of the conflict."
11," [For] Trade is bilateral and will always involve a mutual compromise. If we define atmanirbharta as an ideal ratio of trade to GDP sweet spot - then US has it around 10% and India is at 18%. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_trade-to-GDP_ratio) If trade dependence is too less, then India risks being poor and if it is too much, then India risks being too sensitive to world policies. However, besides volume, India should also diversify trade partners. too much IT export only to the US or one group is like putting all eggs in one basket. if IT export is indeed India's strength, then it should significantly export to countries other than US as well"
12," usa is tech superpower , so even if you want to diversify there are no other customers"
13," I would like to honestly from bottom of my heart and brain to abstain from saying for and against. See each individual is different. Some people tend to work for some years in corporate then resign and start their own business. In order to remain self reliant , we need to change some of the peoples mindset to encourage people to pursue entrepreneurship which is happening nowadays. I think if we could leverage our IT engineers skills , we can build a Made In India platform like Indian Version of Google. And create a service startup ecosystem. That will spur others to come on board. People can do either goods or services business and it depends on the business acumen of a person. Companies like Reliance didn't start so easily so it takes time to build trust. That is one thing that startups need to understand."
14," I support this. I have lots of ideas on how to accomplish. I made lots of voice notes but  have very little time to transcribe them. Few ideas, not completely ironed but, but just raw are here. May be in a week, when I can find time, I'll revisit this document and enlarge ideas. This is in continuation to the post I've made on reddit on why we need an India specific social media networks and you can see it here. These are rough ideas not as clearly organized as I wish it should be but, this is the first attempt and there will be multiple revisions of this document and finally we will make sure that this is presented as a Member bill in Parliament. Now let's talk about the basic infrastructure i.e. a real estate over which the social media can be deployed. Govt supports by providing storage and internet infrastructure to social media companies. By this we don't necessarily mean that government develop and maintain data center infrastructure. Govt can also call for companies to develop them on a contract basis. Any social media company can be run on such an infrastructure. Multiple social media companies can make use of such services provided that they follow rules of governance. Certain criteria should be met by the companies and the software that they run. The criteria can be a set of interfaces and software contracts that the company's code will have to adhere to. Also regular audit requirements. The companies pay rent for making use of such infrastructure. We will discover what the criteria actually means while we explore various use cases. And note that all these use cases must meet the criteria of law of the land. Another note on these infrastructure companies is that they don't have a fucking clue about what services are running. They are just infra providers and nothing else. There should be something called an identity service which can verify identity of a person and provide a token of an identification instance to services that are utilizing it. This has to be very independent. Perhaps this is an ideal candidate for national identification online.   It is possible that this identification service is statutory or sanctioned by the government itself. There could be multiple identification services, all adhering to laws stipulated by law. All social media services will avail this identification service to identify a customer. None of the social media companies will actually know the identity of a person but only his reference. Another important point to note is that none of the services own any of the users. Users are just subscribers of a service and that's it. Users are always independent and are citizens of the country and enjoy the rights of the citizens either online or offline. Now let's see how a website such as YouTube be built. Let's consider this as an analogue of our regular cinema halls, producers, distributors, advertisers and audience. Distributors are always registered with a national identity. Distributors will have their own mechanism to identify producers and to the extent they want. A distributor MAY allow anonymous content or not. Since revenue sharing contract is between the both, knowledge of bank accounts is essential. Distributors can agree to purchase content from producers and make them available to audience. Audience pay to watch the video. The price paid by audience could be as low as 1 rupees. Considering that many popular YouTube channels gather around 1 lakh views for a 10 min video, the earnings are significant for the producer. Distributors pay for infrastructure and earn from audience. They can give a cut to producer. Distributors are also free to inject advertisement into videos for non paying audience. It's possible that videos, especially that are time bound such as current events and politics, the value of video is time bound. Distributors may stop streaming the video after a certain period of time. There could be archiving companies that can tie up with distributors to purchase time expired videos and have business of their own. Other customers that want to have a copy of the video after expiry can contact the producer directly and obtain the video. In this model producers pay to upload a video with the distributor for a specific period of time. Here producer hopes to make money when viewed by the users. Distributors can provide a host of recommendation service offered on his platform and producer can choose one of the recommendation engines so that audience can discover them. The government could establish a regulatory authority to oversee the pricing of content. How much should a 10 min content, 15 min content or an hour long movie. This regulatory mechanism is for audience ""ticket"" princes. Govt does step in to reign in the prices for end customer. Audience can also subscribe to various recommendation services, both free as well as commercial to discover the content they desire. These recommendation service can also have public reviews. This may see raise of new wallet services that audience can top up with on a monthly basis. Whenever audience watches a video that is commercial, amount gets automatically deducted from the wallet. Users or audience can also reward the producer with other miscellaneous new breed of services that aren't hitherto not possible. For example audience can buy the producer a free beer in the local bar where he lives. Or a cash coupon that is valid in a given business. This in turn can spur new businesses that are local or regional aggregators. How do users discover content? By default users will be able to view content that they are subscribed to and also according to the category of the content. But users will also be able to subscribe to content discovery mechanisms via a recommendation engine. Users will be able to use a free or a commercial recommendation engine. Various other allied services can also be developed. Reporting service which can collect complaints of content and find ways to process them. Commenting service that can be used to talk about a video. Distributor has no business in running such a service like commenting. Multiple commenting engines may be available on Market and user can choose one of them. There could be a category service that can organize the content and users could choose one of them to organize the videos. There could be archive service that users can use to save the videos they like to the personal library if distributor or producer allows it. Censoring of content must follow the rules of the land. It is possible that producers can upload videos that are misleading, communal, propaganda, anti state and many other categories that may constitute offence under our constitution or law.  An information tribunal must be established as a statutory body that will address these issues. And they will follow the law of the country. In other words, aggrieved party will file an FIR regarding the content. The content will immediately be classified as legally disputed to show caution for the users. Once FIR is registered, a primary inquiry is held and if it is admissible  the court intervenes and resolves the issue. It's possible that we need a completely different kind of browser that is completely optimized for our use cases. When the browser is launched, it takes you to launch page. There is a default one that's provided but can be changed by an extension. All other websites can be registered and are searchable through this browser. It is very much possible that discovery mechanism is different , for example by searching. Every website will register with a common facility and then be discoverable. This is unlike DNS based registration mechanism and ip address based location. All websites that are designed in this platform are completely content based. UI or user experience is an add on supplied by a third party and can be purchased from other third party.  Infact this very closely aligns with the original view of the web.

15," [against] India can have a prosperous IT sector that can cater to both domestic and International clients, if the government can boost domestic entrepreneurship, the need to be dependent on western clients would be less. Government can provide better quality education from the start and create more IIT's, IIMs, etc. to boost domestic capital creation. Further, Government can reduce the Income Inequality to make Indian population itself capable of demanding the high end services, which will further lead to reduced dependence on the west. China while starting globalization, set up multiple SEZs (tax free zones), to attract global producers to produce in china which increased the wage rates and standard of living of those people who were largely farmers. Now china having huge foreign reserves against its currency can do whatever pleases it without the need for those reserves. (just look up how to played the Trade wars). this shows the failure of the Indian Government, (be it any party), to create jobs and provide for it's people. Indian is facing a huge unemployment surge and we're losing our demographic dividend, after few decades India may have a bunch of old people to care for and not enough resources for them, like the Japanese population, (they have the resources though!) The point is the current unemployment scenario is scary and we should not blame the employed for serving the west but try to increase our employment and reduce our dependence!"

1, Yes but it will be worth it. we need to have a robust Education system to encourage Innovation! If corporates fund R&D and universities in India not only will it drive innovation but also give them a quality workforce. political will is the major hindrance in all this! All the legal procedures slow down the budding businesses. A reform is needed in the Ease of Doing Business space. This centre is doing good in this except for heavy taxation on crypto. It is the state governments who need to step up the game.

1," i don't get it, why we can't diversify? we can sell lower quality at a lesser price to non-super powers. just like, we are third world for US, we should strive to emulate with african/s.e. asian countries. e.g. just like rich indians go to US for studies, rich africans/nepalese/vietnamese should see India as an option."
0,"[Against] The world is globalized now, there’s no going back from that. We are all dependent on each other for services, commodities and skilled labour. This introduces efficiency that lowers costs and increases profits and performance of companies that work hard to build a global presence. Cutting ourselves off from that will not make us stronger or more independent. You also need to ask what your vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ is. If it’s going back to the pre-1991 isolated economy, it’s too high a cost. I would rather we have fewer geopolitical options due to globalization than have zero options due to poverty."
1,"most of people here think that isolation would lead to us becoming superpower,  actually it would lead us to pre 1991"
2,"True, however one has to realize that India's Atmanirbhar effort is only for those where there are sanctions that can cripple economy. They are not against importing but if they develop industry they can increase employment and there by taxes too, agrarian economy with exports is also coming, pharma is already there, defense is in the pipeline. Many people don't recognize the soul of India, which is karma bhoomi which maps to Live and let live, unlike other nations that deal on death and misery. Many people don't understand this fine line and speaks in black and white. if you look at history we exported culture and not fear, we didn't export stealing of nations wealth unlike colonialists. This whole argument requires finer thinking rather than just highlevel look. We were global before others were global."

5,"[against] The same is the case with manufacturing. So while the service sector is a large segment, it's just one variable in a multivariate equation. Truth is, one cannot be completely 'atmnirbhar' - countries will always be dependent on others for the (geographically) lacking resources. Another way to make India more atmnirbhar (and I'm just focusing on my own relative expertise in this domain here) is to develop better, bigger and more robust supply chains within the country so that imports from other countries aren't necessarily a cheaper alternative - thus not only reducing imports, but also supporting local businesses."
6,"I would like to honestly from bottom of my heart and brain to abstain from saying for and against. See each individual is different. Some people tend to work for some years in corporate then resign and start their own business. In order to remain self reliant , we need to change some of the peoples mindset to encourage people to pursue entrepreneurship which is happening nowadays. I think if we could leverage our IT engineers skills , we can build a Made In India platform like Indian Version of Google. And create a service startup ecosystem. That will spur others to come on board. People can do either goods or services business and it depends on the business acumen of a person. Companies like Reliance didn't start so easily so it takes time to build trust. That is one thing that startups need to understand."
7,"I support this. I have lots of ideas on how to accomplish. I made lots of voice notes but  have very little time to transcribe them. Few ideas, not completely ironed but, but just raw are here. May be in a week, when I can find time, I'll revisit this document and enlarge ideas. This is in continuation to the post I've made on reddit on why we need an India specific social media networks and you can see it here. These are rough ideas not as clearly organized as I wish it should be but, this is the first attempt and there will be multiple revisions of this document and finally we will make sure that this is presented as a Member bill in Parliament. Now let's talk about the basic infrastructure i.e. a real estate over which the social media can be deployed. Govt supports by providing storage and internet infrastructure to social media companies. By this we don't necessarily mean that government develop and maintain data center infrastructure. Govt can also call for companies to develop them on a contract basis. Any social media company can be run on such an infrastructure. Multiple social media companies can make use of such services provided that they follow rules of governance. Certain criteria should be met by the companies and the software that they run. The criteria can be a set of interfaces and software contracts that the company's code will have to adhere to. Also regular audit requirements. The companies pay rent for making use of such infrastructure. We will discover what the criteria actually means while we explore various use cases. And note that all these use cases must meet the criteria of law of the land. Another note on these infrastructure companies is that they don't have a fucking clue about what services are running. They are just infra providers and nothing else. There should be something called an identity service which can verify identity of a person and provide a token of an identification instance to services that are utilizing it. This has to be very independent. Perhaps this is an ideal candidate for national identification online.   It is possible that this identification service is statutory or sanctioned by the government itself. There could be multiple identification services, all adhering to laws stipulated by law. All social media services will avail this identification service to identify a customer. None of the social media companies will actually know the identity of a person but only his reference. Another important point to note is that none of the services own any of the users. Users are just subscribers of a service and that's it. Users are always independent and are citizens of the country and enjoy the rights of the citizens either online or offline. Now let's see how a website such as YouTube be built. Let's consider this as an analogue of our regular cinema halls, producers, distributors, advertisers and audience. Distributors are always registered with a national identity. Distributors will have their own mechanism to identify producers and to the extent they want. A distributor MAY allow anonymous content or not. Since revenue sharing contract is between the both, knowledge of bank accounts is essential. Distributors can agree to purchase content from producers and make them available to audience. Audience pay to watch the video. The price paid by audience could be as low as 1 rupees. Considering that many popular YouTube channels gather around 1 lakh views for a 10 min video, the earnings are significant for the producer. Distributors pay for infrastructure and earn from audience. They can give a cut to producer. Distributors are also free to inject advertisement into videos for non paying audience. It's possible that videos, especially that are time bound such as current events and politics, the value of video is time bound. Distributors may stop streaming the video after a certain period of time. There could be archiving companies that can tie up with distributors to purchase time expired videos and have business of their own. Other customers that want to have a copy of the video after expiry can contact the producer directly and obtain the video. In this model producers pay to upload a video with the distributor for a specific period of time. Here producer hopes to make money when viewed by the users. Distributors can provide a host of recommendation service offered on his platform and producer can choose one of the recommendation engines so that audience can discover them. The government could establish a regulatory authority to oversee the pricing of content. How much should a 10 min content, 15 min content or an hour long movie.

Users or audience can also reward the producer with other miscellaneous new breed of services that aren't hitherto not possible.

9,"Against - We can’t be self reliant until electric vehicle become mainstream and we no longer have to rely on imports. Until then we need to rely on goods and services exports and remittances for foreign exchange, which can be used for paying for imports. Railway electrification and metro systems are helping here. And we are still lower middle income country, so poverty will shoot up in case of sanctions. To become upper middle income country we badly need software exports, which will stop drainage of our foreign exchange reserves. India goods exports consist of raw material imports, we even export refined oil which is fully import dependent. While software export needs almost zero imports, except some laptop/pc chips which we would need for other purposes anyway Russia isn’t affected by sanctions because they don’t have to import oil, and also they were developed country above upper middle income level before the start of the conflict."
10,"[For] Trade is bilateral and will always involve a mutual compromise. If we define atmanirbharta as an ideal ratio of trade to GDP sweet spot - then US has it around 10% and India is at 18%. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_trade-to-GDP_ratio) If trade dependence is too less, then India risks being poor and if it is too much, then India risks being too sensitive to world policies. However, besides volume, India should also diversify trade partners. too much IT export only to the US or one group is like putting all eggs in one basket. if IT export is indeed India's strength, then it should significantly export to countries other than US as well"
11,"usa is tech superpower , so even if you want to diversify there are no other customers"
12,"Key sector where becoming aatmanirbhar is the only option. [For] Semiconductors: This needs no explanation the whole world can't rely on Taiwan. Defence and Aerospace : Indian startups have a huge market since government import majority of our equipment. And in Coming decades space exploration will boom if we start working now we will be in a better position. New technologies like quantum computing, blockchain, artificial intelligence have huge potential and can be game changer for our economy. EV and renewable energy: We should not be reliant on fossil fuels for or energy consumption. But of course we will have to import many goods and services and raw material but India being such a large country should not choke due supply chain issue. Coming conflicts will make globalisation obsolete."

27,"[ Against ] You can't cut your exports cause you want to be self reliant. Service exports bring in money and reducing that is kneecaping your economy now for the perceived threat of conflict in the future. As other people said atmanirbharata is good in certain key industries so our supply chains can't be crippled, but by no means should it be interpreted as economic isolation. Patch key bottlenecks like energy, military and semiconductors. Don't cut exports !"
28,"+1, be aatmnirbhar on imports, not exports"
30,Only time will tell but we are in a multipolar world so ease of globalisation will reduce.
31,India needs alternatives to help cushion the effect of weaponisation of private companies by West. Jio is a very critical company in this regard.
32,"[For] To preface my post, what exactly do you mean by 'aatmanirbhar'? The world is too interdependent for a single country to be fully self sufficient. So let me try to define it for the purpose of my post. I define it on a gradient and 'aatmanirbhar' being a journey/process to be relatively more self sufficient rather than a absolute state. And with this definition, I'm for the notion that we're not on the right path towards self sufficiency when major part of our employment comes from the services sector. The most obvious thing is that the interests of the foreign employer becomes the interests of the country as it'll affect the livelihood of the citizens. We're essentially exporting labour. Manufacturing/design skill transfer will only happen if those are done here. Service sector would just be endlessly performing just that. There is no levelling up. It's easy to cut us off the international system because again we can't produce much internally. Also imported goods cost more and result in a cash flow out of the country."

38,"[For] We will have to first jump into the pool to get out of it later. Let me explain. To be truly independent, we need technological independence, energy independence, knowledge base, and resource independence. To achieve all of this, India will need to first participate in the global economic system in all fields to gain in depth expertise and working knowledge. Once we start this process, domestic industries can steadily and progressively start replacing those products and services on which we currently depend on foreign companies. Additionally, we will have to build up enough of a knowledge and innovation base through proper R&D spending in companies and universities, so that we don't rely on western innovation for all our technological progress. For energy and resource independence, we will have to figure out Thorium power, so that we are no longer reliant on oil imports for which we have to use dollars and buy from the Middle East. Resource independence is also possible if they figure out how to make semiconductors and batteries with minerals available within India rather than rare earth minerals available abroad."
39,"[Against] The service sector provides a better quality of life. Recently several experts highlighted the problems that China is facing today, which is the labor shortage to run its manufacturing infrastructure which it has built all these years since independence. As the per capita income of an average Chinese citizen is increasing, the Chinese are switching to the better quality of life that the service sector provides where you can work in comfortable AC rooms unlike the manufacturing sector which is mainly labor driven. Now a days China is pressurizing its own citizens to go back to manufacturing sector and keep working at low wages to keep the manufacturing offer lucrative for the big brands to not move their investments to countries like India or south eastern nations. Now i dont know which way is better to go about. But today India is using is its huge capital attained through the service driven economy in various ways in leapfrogging in the manufacturing sector. You must have read about Taiwan is investing in India for chip manufacturing and many global big brands like apple have created their manufacturing units in India. Also not that India is letting private entities come in Space sector and easing rules like the recent drone rules. Also Indian government is offering many schemes to attract the foreign investment and also fixing the system to increase investor confidence. Doing away with retrospective taxation was one such move. So i see ki ""Achhe Din Hum Laane Waale Hain"". ;)"
40,"[Against] I disagree with the framing of the motion. The reason we are not aatmanirbhar is because many of our basic needs aren't being met internally (energy, chemicals, capital goods, defence, electronics). IT sector happens to pay the bills to fund our basic needs right now. Else, India would have been another Sri Lanka. Instead of reducing IT sector dependence on the west, I would focus on other needs. Let's appreciate the human capital of our IT workers which has been powering the digital transformation world over. I hope it remains strong forever. Also, let's not harbor a myopic vision of complete independence. Even in historic times, India traded with Romans for spices. The answer is always interdependence but from a position of strength. That's what we are targeting with the ""Aatmanirbhar"" campaign. Else, we wouldn't be signing FTAs. Let's talk about energy, chemicals, defence, electronics to begin with. The IT sector can take care of itself - look at how TCS, Infosys transformed their growth in the recent years."
42,The atmanirbhar initiative isn’t about turning India into an isolated  economy. It’s about turning India into a net exporter in everything and our IT sector has been doing this for a while. IT sector isn’t what’s wrong with atmanirbhar but what’s right about atmanirbhar. China exports a shit ton to US but because there are still lockdowns and restrictions and supply chain issues in China US is facing 11% inflation. China was importing cheap coal from Australia but because Australia demanded a fair investigation into the covid pandemic China stopped buying coal from them and now China is facing an energy shortage it has not faced in decades. Russia has no exports to speak of except for weapons. Exports won’t be as big of an Achilles heel as you think during sanctions.
