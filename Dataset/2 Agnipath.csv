0,The what now? They can't chill can they? Another shitty ass scheme to stress us even further
1,I don't think ye forced scheme hai
2,It is not forced. Volunteer basically.
4,"Definitely not yielding good. I dont think that after the army tenure, those young exiting agniveers will be left employable..Also theres 7 months(dk exactly) of training period and this leaves us with 3.5 years and do u think someone will train so much physically and mentally for such a short period of time? Also no benefits. After the military tenure, most probably the leaving army person would be 22-25, and they cant even target govt job exams and private jobs bcoz u know what the situation would be. This scheme is just like mudiji's(and BJPs) previous futile schemes and plans like demonetisation & GST."
5,"It has already told by army chiefs that after their tenure,they can again join the army.Also they are given reservation in many ministries so that they can join. Also being unemployed,even before joining this they are unemployed.And are not forced to join this,it is voluntarily."
7,4 saal free naukri üòéa
9,"Isme galat kya hain? Jisko jana hai jaye, jisko nahi jana hai nahi jaye. stop burning trains like retards"
10,what is it?
11,"I don't think it's as bad as some people make it to be. 25% of the Agniveers will be selected to server further, so if want you serve longer, you'll have to work hard. Even if you leave the military after 4 years, it's highly possible that you'll have a degree/ some extra educational qualifications in your hand because the Army does help you in getting one."
0,Scheme to be 'put on hold' like CAA soon ?
1,Now we wait for Rihanna and Justin Trudeaus comments
2,"Everything & anything is being protested in India because protesters have learnt the weaknesses of this government. If they had put down the earlier protest and shown consequences of destroying public property then, there would have been a different lesson learnt by the mobs/citizens but this soft approach has created a Frankenstein's monster & ordinary citizens will suffer."
3,"This is true. Post 2020, this government has been unable to implement any significant major reform despite having a comfortable majority. CAA and Farm laws being prime examples, even Electricity Amendment Act was not tabled out of the fear of protests. Doesn't really feel like a majority government."
5,"These motherfuckers only want to join the army so they have job security and want pensions,  what these dumbfucks  don't know is that IA is very large it needs to be reduced so that more money goes to modernization and per soldier expenditure increases so the government can provide them better equipment."
6,wtf is wrong with people these days? I mean they want to protest for everything/anything. It shows how deep hatred they have towards Modi govt.
7,"Modern armies need to be quality, not quantity equipped with cheap equipment which can gives drones free kills. Or are we for another round of thousand year humiliation when we with our stupid obsession of elephants our huge armies got beated by small  but mobile and quick armies of muslim horse archers. Modern warfare is gonna be low risk quick drones. Just see how much Russians got killed by those cheap Turkish drones. When war with Pakistan will come turkey will supply them to pakistan too, China i believe is also making their own drones. Now though Russians are getting upperhand but too much blood has been flown for that."
8,"completely Agree, our only upper hand from PLA is our quality manpower,do people seriously think a person who is working in army as a contract worker for 4 years will sacrifice his life for the nation?? people are really naive, even the RW pro Govt defence experts like GD bhakshi are critical of it"
10,"What we need is less recruits but better equipped, we can use more recruits for internal stability which we at this point need as much as border security. These internal security guys can be agnipath people. Border security ain't gonna cut by 4 year tenure people."
11,Benefit of this scheme is to put youth on right track. In 4 years they will learn so many things and makes them so much capable. Also youth get to learn discipline principles and importantly country is first. Also less corrupted person in longer run. After 4 years they can join state police. Or can start business. It's about developing skill that you only get in army and 17 to 21 is the age to develop right skills and mindset for your whole life. Those idiots doesn't understand all this.
12,okay then why even having things like 4 year of shitaint that a waste of money ??term them too as anti nationalno one gonna risk their life for security of country and rather focus building their career or which job to pick after they get out of this 4 year shitfuckrywe are training soldier for country not playing some chor police shit
13,"Here comes another dumbhead, go and see the ways In other countries they treat the military and as service and after the contract end, they leave not like you who consider armed forces as abbuji ka dhaba that once you will go and will leave on tax payers money for life time. These plans are made by professionals who know the scene better than a keyboard warrior sitting in his room . Rejected 75% will have benefits in higher education, loans, and preference in CAPF, and other paramilitary forces, we have to make IA a technologically driven modern force and not a lifelong employment guarantee scheme for old duchebags, sitting and eating on taxpayers' money."
14,"wtf dudenow tag them with anti nationalthis rebranding shit is absolute cringeif u wanted to test this project of agniveer then do it on pilot project and show the public the result of it rather than playing with someone's careerif u provide them a training of 4 year, how better do you think can they become as a soldier  and how much time will they serve most of the people in army come from a very poor backgroundthey can't afford to be a lab rat of gormint"
15,"Gov should either reduce the number of recruitment for minimizing budget, rather than recruiting boys whos pubg experience will be more than actual combat experience, Imagine these chaps fighting Chinese army üòÇ"
16,Absolutely. Everything you don't agree with is the doing of an outside force. I personally think its the Tyranids or Lichtenstein. It's a horrible scheme. Any number of military experts and historians will concur.
17,"This is fucking worst ! I myself from army background and I really opposes this ! Village ke ladke jinke paas bas army hi ek sahara tha unka future toh gaya ! Even in my father's unit army officers aren't happy with this ! People are giving example of US army to defend this but Bhai vo US hai oor ye India, yaha par 15 - 20 saal wale ex - army soldiers ko mushkil se Guard ki naukri mill rahi hai oor tumhe kya lagta hai itne saare Bunch me released ex-army men jinhone sir 3-4 saal serve kiya hai unko Naukri kaha se mill jaegi ?"
18,Mujhe to ye lag raha divide create karega ye army me. Jo regular soldiers hain vo in 4 years k soldiers ko acche se treat nahi karenge. Vaise bhi helper ki tarah soldiers ko use karne ki bat hum sunte rahate hain. Ye jo 3-4 saal hai jo padhne likhne k hain une vo log apna time waste kar denge jabki pata h unko 75% ko bahar niklana hi hai. India k pass manpower ki kami nahi jo aise agni veer ki jarurat pade.
20,"Yep, sena me ab inn new soilders se kutto ko tarah kaam karane wale hai, oor koi mana bhi nahi kar sakta kyoki top 25% me jo aana hai"
0,Go to YouTube and watch any news channel
1,Wait. News channels called gaurakshak lynching as dharmyuddh. Am part of bajrang dal now. Am i doing it right?
2,Wow very helpful.
3,South East har jagah protest hai :)
4,"I have a question, like what is the new percentage of recruitments(before 25% segregation)in army as compared to previous scheme."
5,Army should not be responsible for employment.
6,"FYI, City boys aren't even competing to join grade B jobs that Agnipath scheme offers. The normal recruitment (Recruitment before Agnipath Scheme was launched) that used to take place used to happen in rural India. The recruits get commissioned as Jawans, Air Men or Sailors in the Army, IAF and Navy respectively.  So, it is a very rare case that someone from the city will join or prepare to join the Tri-services through Agnipath Scheme."
7,"Before this scheme, if you joined the army you had employment for roughly around 9-10 years‚Ä¶ you joined around the age 18 after passing your 12th‚Ä¶ you could provide for your family for a decade after that‚Ä¶ probably get your younger siblings through their graduation or pay off one or two mortgage‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs been reduced to 4 years now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs that ‚Äúin between‚Äù amount of years‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not insignificant enough where you finish your tour of duty and come back to continue your education yourself, nor is it long enough that you can consistently provide for your family‚Ä¶  though the payment is better than before it‚Äôs not again not log enough to do either this or that‚Ä¶ in Kannada there‚Äôs a thing called ‚Äúbisi thuppa‚Äù (Hot Ghee) ‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt let it go to waste, but you can‚Äôt swallow it‚Ä¶"
8,Understood. Thank you very much
10,"When there are thousands of vacancies in the army, the government comes up with this contractual scheme. The outrage isn‚Äôt surprising. After completion of the contract, people may end up with menial jobs and some might even choose to indulge in antisocial activities. Most importantly, 6 months isn‚Äôt enough for army training."
11,"It's the retention criteria that is quite concerning as only a selective lot (25%) would be allowed to continue to serve in the forces while the rest would be let go. I also feel this may add more pressure for the officers as the officer-JCO/ORs ratio is skewed in every regiment and naturally the rejected cohort of Agniveers would lose their morale in the last year of their employment in the forces. I've heard that initially General Bipin Rawat had proposed this scheme for Officer level personnel as well. Apparently, the idea is to cut down the pension bill of the armed forces. But they have rolled it out only for JCOs and ORs levels for now. So, in case this scheme turns out to be a success, it could be rolled out for officers in the future too."
12,For 2 years normal recruitment have been put on hold citing covid. This year they were expecting 2-3 worth of recruitment. They got this instead.
13,I believe they canceled lot of normal recruitment exams in this year and suggested candidates to apply through Agniveer/Agnipath scheme. At least least this is what the students protesting in Hyderabad have been saying. This triggered a lot of the protests as students who were preparing for years and even cleared the physical exams as well felt robbed of the opportunities which available right before Agnipath policy announcements
14,"The goal of pension bill reduction works only if agniveer is the normal mode of recruitment. Nowhere in the original MoD press release did they indicate that regular recruitment will go on. In any case, there has been no regular recruitment since March 2022 and now also, there is no indication of resumption of regular recruitment"
17,"You are 630,65,369 potential candidate for post of UP CM"
19,These are supposed to be extra jobs I think. I heard it on a news channel so I can't be sure but I don't understand what's the problem with extra jobs. The normal hiring will continue as they used to
20,Normal hiring has stalled for many years.
21,The Agnipath scheme has been mooted with the primary objective of reducing the wage and pension burden on the government. Do you think these will be extra jobs in this context? Are you aware that the usual hiring has been frozen for a couple of years?
22,I don‚Äôt think ‚Äòjobs‚Äô are ever extra.
23,I just tune in to Chessbase India.
24,"In the earlier system, troops joined in for 17 years, which could be extended for certain personnel. 17 years meant a permanent job, pension after retirement and entitlement to different allowances etc. In new system, the duration of service would be 4 years only and retention would be 25% (people who would serve beyond 4 years). This system is NOT optional and all officers below officer ranks would be now selected through this route ONLY. Hence the protest."
25,So goverment spent money and recources training a future soldier and that soldier  desperately wants to work in that job but being chucked out coz only 25% would be retained . All the skills that person learned is maybe useless in another field so that person has to start a another career from scratch all over again .
26,Unemployment.
29,Indian economy isn‚Äôt sufficient enough to sustain the army under NDA government. That‚Äôs why there have been no recruitments since many years. There have been no recruitment in state and central owned industries for this very reason.
30,It's not 25%. It's upto 25%. It's like a *conditions apply scheme for army recruitment lol
32,"Not really actually. Just today, the govt announced that the other 75 % would get priority in state govt jobs and centre govt jobs including that of CAPFs and Assam Rifles. Also...mental models, discipline and many other attributes aquired during the training program would not be wasted. Also, both NIOS and IGNOU are trying to develop programs so that they don't have to start from scratch."
33,I have seen most people saying it's 25% who will be retained from the scheme. But it's upto 25%. This is a major point to notice. And to answer your question it's the last hope for folks from Bihar and UP who want to escape out of the poverty cycle as well as doing something good for the country. They want something which is assured for rest of their life and not a 4 year stint to be running around for jobs again.
0,"Yeah dude do you know anything about the Army?? If not, keep your opinion to yourself. It's a shitty idea."
1,"Yep these civilians are idiots supporting this shit scheme, I am myself from army background and opposing this shit ! Pahle jaisa tha vahi accha tha, modi sarkar paise bachne ke liye bekar kaam kar rahi hai !"
2,"It will reduce the size of the army gradually and the size of the pensions substantially which is desperately needed. We spend 50-60 percent budget on pensions, while other armies for example china spend 30 percent. We will have more to spend on technology. I am not sure if it will affect combat effectiveness, hopefully not since we are selecting top 25 percent. If the top 25 percent are selected by the teachers after 4 yrs themselves it is a shitty idea, if there is merit based evaluation plus teachers input then it is good. We need better employment generation in this country tho, BJP is so scared of being called suit boot ki sarkar by idiot commies, they have not been as good on industrialisation, which is the only way this country will rise."
3,"Excellent Idea Similar program exists in US. Many people join Army/Marine after high school; serve for few years and come out. After coming out of this, they stay as reserve force; and go on to join Police, Fire-fighter, private security, sports, heavy vehicle operator etc. These people also get several benefit from corporate world in terms of discounts, recruitment etc. Many employers prefer such people because they are highly disciplined and reliable. Many people in India are not suited for a formal education after 12th standard. Instead of going into BA and other ""easy courses"", they can join the Army. 4 years in Army can develop/mould their personality and make them ready for a wide variety of work."
4,"USA=India, logic left the house."
5,It‚Äôs a terrible scheme . Govt is getting cannon fodder for its requirement but very bad for aspirants .
7,"Exactly! this is the US model. IA soldiers are trained for a full year compared to three months for US soldiers.IA will lower the training time leading to lower standards. People will stop trying to get along as they know they are leaving in 4 years. Back in the day, Artillery was  a large arm and officers were not putting as much effort into getting along as chances of serving together in the future postinga were slim. Army actually formed unofficial groups where officer would rotate within certain units to develop esprit d corps."
9,"Why don't they do a similar scheme for politicians.....? Serve for 4 years and then leave. No pensions.... Politicians don't need to give any exams, whereas Army exams include both physical and written exams, which I am sure 50 percent of politicians would fail in both... This govt is doing a botched up job governing this country... Time for a change, I guess?"

9,"This government has destroyed the Indian economy. Today, under NDA government, Indian economy isn‚Äôt sufficient to maintain army personnel and the benefits that come with the job. This is demoralising and an insult to the aspirants."
10,"Indian economy isn‚Äôt sufficient to maintain army personnel The problem is that the dependence on the armed forces for employment has become too much due to lack of other viable employment opportunities, especially in the age group that has been impacted in this scheme."
11,"Pensions take up a larger portion of the military‚Äôs budget now than ever before.  Almost 50% now.  Unless you want to cut funding for other forms of public welfare to accommodate the increasing pensions, there‚Äôs no real choice.  This should have been done a long time ago."
12,Do we have an official statement around this?
13,Watch the press conference
14,"Fuck, the next few days are going to be trouble I guess. I guess this was the actual intent of the original notification but wasnt being publicly stated. This effectively cuts off a ton of people suddenly from hope of getting a permanent job during the most hormonally volatile times of their life. I know of entire villages dedicated to practising PT and such with the sole aim of joing the forces. I think with this move, the BJP has offically put its hand in a hornet's nest."
15,Aayega phir bhi Modi hee. Likh ke le lo.
16,"'shock and awe type of policy making', they say.."
19,"Then won't you think the current situation is the worst time to introduce these reforms. When unemployment is at record levels and no amry intake for last 2 years. The army Lt.

20,Now... Agneepath for armed forces.. Later... Louhapath for railways... Rajpath for civil services... Mudrapath for banks....

30,Go check what portion of the pensions are allocated to defence civilians and what portion to people actually fighting with guns. This so called nationalist govt just robbed the country's fighting soldiers of their pensions and you are busy licking balls.
31,Good.
33,I can already see bhakt mental gymnastics on this thread.
34,"India is vishwaguru, no one will dare to attack us any more, so we don't need the Army, the youth can now get into other patriotic job sectors like IT cell and gauraksha.."

40,"People angry about something they never had and they not gonna have? Boo fuckin hoo. Why not find a different line of work to be interested in? Also, shouldn't countries be working towards disarming and having no army at all? There are countries in the world already doing it and don't even have an army any longer. I get the with India having enemies no both sides of the country(country of hate at work no surprise here) in the north there needs some forces. But ideally, we should be working towards it as well. I mean, no one's gonna invade this place anyway. Millions of army personal to defend against whom exactly? Why would anyone want to come here anymore? Invade and take what exactly? There's nothing left in this shit hole of a country expect useless unemployed, uneducated & religious lunatics burning up the place over the last couple of years."
41,"Woah woah woah take a chill pal. Don't be offended if I call you a lunatic and neither be ashamed of having a appointment with an Therapist cause you wouldn't have said same words if there was a bomb under your ass or if you were rather standing on LOC rather than talking crap about the importance of armed forces from your home, dipshit."

45,Haan ye baat to hai bas saamne walon ko samajh nahi aata kya soch ke karte hain üòÇ
51,"Why do you assume I have a problem in reducing pensions for defense civilians?  This is simply a start and hopefully pensions will be cut all across the board.  The United States only spends 10% of the military‚Äôs budget on pensions, the UK only 14%.  What the hell is India doing??? What solution do you have for the bloat? More taxes? -edit- a good article worth reading https://theprint.in/opinion/indias-defence-pension-bill-affecting-military-5-myths-busted/379289/?amp"
53,So in short only officers recruitment would be on permanant basis? Rest would be recruited through Agniveer?
54,"THe problem is yearly there is 50,000 vacancy for army soldiers . Selection ration is about 1:25 . So almost like 10-12 lakhs youth is engaged into that . Most of them are farmer's son . They don't have much oppurtunity . Killing the dream of so many can lead to sociological issues in society I think they will still go for agniveer , they don't have much of a choice . Its the army which will suffer , half the soldier's will be in tourist mode"
55,"India needs modernization, not more personnel, in military. Future warfares will be automated. We need more automation(ml and ai) capabilities. Having more personnel helps, but, not once you are going to fight against a country having ai robots which can be mass produced at a far far far faster rates than humans can be enrolled and trained. Begin by setting up state of the art chip manufacturing plant, clubbed with centers of future technologies like AI, robotics, quantum mechanics, space aviation and cyber intelligence. These are the knobs we should be playing with to safeguard our country's future."
56,"Like the war between Russia & Ukraine right now, fully automated. /S"

1," Yep, sena me ab inn new soilders se kutto ko tarah kaam karane wale hai, oor koi mana bhi nahi kar sakta kyoki top 25% me jo aana hai"
1," I have a question, like what is the new percentage of recruitments(before 25% segregation)in army as compared to previous scheme."
2, Army should not be responsible for employment.
3," FYI, City boys aren't even competing to join grade B jobs that Agnipath scheme offers. The normal recruitment (Recruitment before Agnipath Scheme was launched) that used to take place used to happen in rural India. The recruits get commissioned as Jawans, Air Men or Sailors in the Army, IAF and Navy respectively.  So, it is a very rare case that someone from the city will join or prepare to join the Tri-services through Agnipath Scheme."
5," When there are thousands of vacancies in the army, the government comes up with this contractual scheme. The outrage isn‚Äôt surprising. After completion of the contract, people may end up with menial jobs and some might even choose to indulge in antisocial activities. Most importantly, 6 months isn‚Äôt enough for army training."
6," It's the retention criteria that is quite concerning as only a selective lot (25%) would be allowed to continue to serve in the forces while the rest would be let go. I also feel this may add more pressure for the officers as the officer-JCO/ORs ratio is skewed in every regiment and naturally the rejected cohort of Agniveers would lose their morale in the last year of their employment in the forces. I've heard that initially General Bipin Rawat had proposed this scheme for Officer level personnel as well. Apparently, the idea is to cut down the pension bill of the armed forces. But they have rolled it out only for JCOs and ORs levels for now. So, in case this scheme turns out to be a success, it could be rolled out for officers in the future too."
8," Before this scheme, if you joined the army you had employment for roughly around 9-10 years‚Ä¶ you joined around the age 18 after passing your 12th‚Ä¶ you could provide for your family for a decade after that‚Ä¶ probably get your younger siblings through their graduation or pay off one or two mortgage‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs been reduced to 4 years now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs that ‚Äúin between‚Äù amount of years‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not insignificant enough where you finish your tour of duty and come back to continue your education yourself, nor is it long enough that you can consistently provide for your family‚Ä¶  though the payment is better than before it‚Äôs not again not log enough to do either this or that‚Ä¶ in Kannada there‚Äôs a thing called ‚Äúbisi thuppa‚Äù (Hot Ghee) ‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt let it go to waste, but you can‚Äôt swallow it‚Ä¶"
9, Understood. Thank you very much
10, I just tune in to Chessbase India.
11," In the earlier system, troops joined in for 17 years, which could be extended for certain personnel. 17 years meant a permanent job, pension after retirement and entitlement to different allowances etc. In new system, the duration of service would be 4 years only and retention would be 25% (people who would serve beyond 4 years). This system is NOT optional and all officers below officer ranks would be now selected through this route ONLY. Hence the protest."
12, So goverment spent money and recources training a future soldier and that soldier  desperately wants to work in that job but being chucked out coz only 25% would be retained . All the skills that person learned is maybe useless in another field so that person has to start a another career from scratch all over again .
13, Unemployment.
15, Wait. News channels called gaurakshak lynching as dharmyuddh. Am part of bajrang dal now. Am i doing it right?
16, Wow very helpful.
17, I have seen most people saying it's 25% who will be retained from the scheme. But it's upto 25%. This is a major point to notice. And to answer your question it's the last hope for folks from Bihar and UP who want to escape out of the poverty cycle as well as doing something good for the country. They want something which is assured for rest of their life and not a 4 year stint to be running around for jobs again.
1, For 2 years normal recruitment have been put on hold citing covid. This year they were expecting 2-3 worth of recruitment. They got this instead.
2, I believe they canceled lot of normal recruitment exams in this year and suggested candidates to apply through Agniveer/Agnipath scheme. At least least this is what the students protesting in Hyderabad have been saying. This triggered a lot of the protests as students who were preparing for years and even cleared the physical exams as well felt robbed of the opportunities which available right before Agnipath policy announcements
3," The goal of pension bill reduction works only if agniveer is the normal mode of recruitment. Nowhere in the original MoD press release did they indicate that regular recruitment will go on. In any case, there has been no regular recruitment since March 2022 and now also, there is no indication of resumption of regular recruitment"
1, Indian economy isn‚Äôt sufficient enough to sustain the army under NDA government. That‚Äôs why there have been no recruitments since many years. There have been no recruitment in state and central owned industries for this very reason.
2, It's not 25%. It's upto 25%. It's like a *conditions apply scheme for army recruitment lol
0, These are supposed to be extra jobs I think. I heard it on a news channel so I can't be sure but I don't understand what's the problem with extra jobs. The normal hiring will continue as they used to
1, Normal hiring has stalled for many years.
2, The Agnipath scheme has been mooted with the primary objective of reducing the wage and pension burden on the government. Do you think these will be extra jobs in this context? Are you aware that the usual hiring has been frozen for a couple of years?
3, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äòjobs‚Äô are ever extra.
1," Not really actually. Just today, the govt announced that the other 75 % would get priority in state govt jobs and centre govt jobs including that of CAPFs and Assam Rifles. Also...mental models, discipline and many other attributes aquired during the training program would not be wasted. Also, both NIOS and IGNOU are trying to develop programs so that they don't have to start from scratch."

2," Yeah dude do you know anything about the Army?? If not, keep your opinion to yourself. It's a shitty idea."
3," Yep these civilians are idiots supporting this shit scheme, I am myself from army background and opposing this shit ! Pahle jaisa tha vahi accha tha, modi sarkar paise bachne ke liye bekar kaam kar rahi hai !"
4," It will reduce the size of the army gradually and the size of the pensions substantially which is desperately needed. We spend 50-60 percent budget on pensions, while other armies for example china spend 30 percent. We will have more to spend on technology. I am not sure if it will affect combat effectiveness, hopefully not since we are selecting top 25 percent. If the top 25 percent are selected by the teachers after 4 yrs themselves it is a shitty idea, if there is merit based evaluation plus teachers input then it is good. We need better employment generation in this country tho, BJP is so scared of being called suit boot ki sarkar by idiot commies, they have not been as good on industrialisation, which is the only way this country will rise."
5, It‚Äôs a terrible scheme . Govt is getting cannon fodder for its requirement but very bad for aspirants .
6," Excellent Idea Similar program exists in US. Many people join Army/Marine after high school; serve for few years and come out. After coming out of this, they stay as reserve force; and go on to join Police, Fire-fighter, private security, sports, heavy vehicle operator etc. These people also get several benefit from corporate world in terms of discounts, recruitment etc. Many employers prefer such people because they are highly disciplined and reliable. Many people in India are not suited for a formal education after 12th standard. Instead of going into BA and other ""easy courses"", they can join the Army. 4 years in Army can develop/mould their personality and make them ready for a wide variety of work."
7," USA=India, logic left the house."
8," Why don't they do a similar scheme for politicians.....? Serve for 4 years and then leave. No pensions.... Politicians don't need to give any exams, whereas Army exams include both physical and written exams, which I am sure 50 percent of politicians would fail in both... This govt is doing a botched up job governing this country... Time for a change, I guess?"
1," Exactly! this is the US model. IA soldiers are trained for a full year compared to three months for US soldiers.IA will lower the training time leading to lower standards. People will stop trying to get along as they know they are leaving in 4 years. Back in the day, Artillery was  a large arm and officers were not putting as much effort into getting along as chances of serving together in the future postinga were slim. Army actually formed unofficial groups where officer would rotate within certain units to develop esprit d corps."

4, I can already see bhakt mental gymnastics on this thread.
5," India is vishwaguru, no one will dare to attack us any more, so we don't need the Army, the youth can now get into other patriotic job sectors like IT cell and gauraksha.."
6," Congrats people, now you have elected a government that doesn't fear and respect its people."
7, Now... Agneepath for armed forces.. Later... Louhapath for railways... Rajpath for civil services... Mudrapath for banks....
8, This but unironically. Do civil services next.
9, Once all this is done.. Footpath is where common man will be..
10, IAS wala sahi ha
11, Chutiyapath for public
12," This government has destroyed the Indian economy. Today, under NDA government, Indian economy isn‚Äôt sufficient to maintain army personnel and the benefits that come with the job. This is demoralising and an insult to the aspirants."
13," Indian economy isn‚Äôt sufficient to maintain army personnel The problem is that the dependence on the armed forces for employment has become too much due to lack of other viable employment opportunities, especially in the age group that has been impacted in this scheme."
14," Pensions take up a larger portion of the military‚Äôs budget now than ever before.  Almost 50% now.  Unless you want to cut funding for other forms of public welfare to accommodate the increasing pensions, there‚Äôs no real choice.  This should have been done a long time ago."
16," THe problem is yearly there is 50,000 vacancy for army soldiers . Selection ration is about 1:25 . So almost like 10-12 lakhs youth is engaged into that . Most of them are farmer's son . They don't have much oppurtunity . Killing the dream of so many can lead to sociological issues in society I think they will still go for agniveer , they don't have much of a choice . Its the army which will suffer , half the soldier's will be in tourist mode"
17, Lode lag gaye.
18, Pakoda production goes brrr..
19," Fuck, the next few days are going to be trouble I guess. I guess this was the actual intent of the original notification but wasnt being publicly stated. This effectively cuts off a ton of people suddenly from hope of getting a permanent job during the most hormonally volatile times of their life. I know of entire villages dedicated to practising PT and such with the sole aim of joing the forces. I think with this move, the BJP has offically put its hand in a hornet's nest."

1," Yes, there will be huge shift to the lateral entry of Bureaucrats based on the area of specialization. I am sure they will do it."
1," Then won't you think the current situation is the worst time to introduce these reforms. When unemployment is at record levels and no amry intake for last 2 years. The army Lt. General says that this was the most painless time to execute, maybe for him it was. But for the people, it's causing them pain."
0," People angry about something they never had and they not gonna have? Boo fuckin hoo. Why not find a different line of work to be interested in? Also, shouldn't countries be working towards disarming and having no army at all? There are countries in the world already doing it and don't even have an army any longer. I get the with India having enemies no both sides of the country(country of hate at work no surprise here) in the north there needs some forces. But ideally, we should be working towards it as well. I mean, no one's gonna invade this place anyway. Millions of army personal to defend against whom exactly? Why would anyone want to come here anymore? Invade and take what exactly? There's nothing left in this shit hole of a country expect useless unemployed, uneducated & religious lunatics burning up the place over the last couple of years."
1," Woah woah woah take a chill pal. Don't be offended if I call you a lunatic and neither be ashamed of having a appointment with an Therapist cause you wouldn't have said same words if there was a bomb under your ass or if you were rather standing on LOC rather than talking crap about the importance of armed forces from your home, dipshit."
