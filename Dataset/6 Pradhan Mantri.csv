0, so much planning went into this entire demonetization exercise that  it we have to create multiple rules every day. By last count 150+ rules in 22 days.
1," Hey, that's how proactive the current government is. Like a chess game, they are analyzing the situation and changing their tactics after every move. BIG /s"
2, By last count 150+ rules in 22 days. And many of these are liekly to be downright unconstitutional. This rule for example: who gives the government any right to tell me how much of my money I can withdraw? Limiting every single jan dhan account because some might be involved in illegal activity is saying something like everyone in bombay is a murder suspect because someone got killed on a local train.
3, Jugaad of Jugaads. Indian minds are very innovative to find flaws and loop holes in system and abuse them. To come up with an non ab-usable law for Indians will be a tough. Instead keep the options open and improvise as and when there is a loop hole. Creates a lot of confusion on scheme of this scale unfortunately!
4, I am still confused about all the tax rules
5," infact i find this good. the BM hoarders are finding jugaads and the govt is smart to not implement all rules and 1 upping them with incremental rules. at the end of the day those who misuse others jan dhan account are fucked. specially those who used dormant accounts. true agility i must say, not making hard fast rules and sitting on them and watch them fail."
6," Release early,iterate often !"
7," The govt is being agile. For every gap that goes large scale, govt fixes/blocks it inn the same week.What's the problem?"
8, Its like a new patch where we find bug and fix it. nothing wrong with that.edit: lol tards
9," If government doesn't change rules fast enough, people complain bureaucracy is lethargic. If government actively tweaks rules, people try to keep a count as though that means something."
10,
11," Hah! If the genuine Jan dhan account holders wish to withdraw more than 10K, he/she'll have to write a letter, detailed accounts of where the money will go, bills/receipts of where the cash is used and wait for the supreme leader to let them have some cash? People speculated that the govt may be slightly disconnected with the ground realities, seems like Modi's hell bent on proving them right."
13," This is scary. The last thing we need is for the poor to have to bribe the bank officials to mark their case as 'genuine', just so as to be able to withdraw their own money."
14, I bet my money that this cap will also change in another 2 days. Govt and RBI is doing all A/B/C/D/E/...Z testing. It is almost like lets throw one by one idea on the wall and see what is sticking.
15, But the demonetisation is supposed to remove corruption and black money from the system! Are you saying that it will gasp fail?!!
1, If not for the /s in this sub you would never be able to tell who is sarcastic and who really means it.
2, someone actually commented shit like this for real
1," Also, once the note is made illegal, the government doesn't have any power to make it legal to use it on petrol pumps/hospitals etc etc. They violated the constitution on a number of issues. All hopes are on the supreme court now. Our opposition is a bunch of idiots."
2, Mudi thinks he is batman. Burn down the entire forest to catch one thief.
3," Alos, they're basically treating people who have cash as ""guilty until proven innocent"". Fundamental principles of justice are being violated here."
4, Look is the govt. freezing the bank accounts? There's only a limit on cash withdrawl right? So it's not like people don't have control of their money. I'm not a bhakt. But some limit on cash withdrawl was fine. As long as they didn't change the rules every hour.
6," unconstitutional Nope. The constitution does not go into currencies. The currency is only a promissory note, not a contract. At best, you can argue that one's constitutional right to life, livelihood, etc are affected. But the Government has the right to derecognise currencies."
7," There is no clause in constitution mentioning this.Please tell me, which fundamental right the government is suspendibg with this. Also,if you know or have read about jan dhan accounts, there were many restriction over its use from the beginning.You do not know.The jan dhan accounts were abused for hoarding black money and it was a right decision."
8," Thing is, Jan Dhan accounts were for the poor and the poor only. 10,000 a month isn't something the poor blow through. Also, the Government can freeze accounts perfectly legally, it is done in case of any suspicion of a crime, even if there is no conviction. Well, yes, technically everyone in the world is a suspect in cases where motives and killer's identity isn't clear. Until the list can be cut down to a shorter and shorter one, everyone is a suspect."
1, You have company in the Prime Minister and Finance Minster.
1, Lauda wasn't this fucking obvious before cancelling the currency? Even a child would've predicted  these accounts were going to be the first go to routes for assorting black money. Is this how you deal with corruption?By taking away basic rights of the citizens?
2," The government is one upping everyone of us, not just the cheats. Think about the poor sod who was saving up money to buy seeds and other farm supplies, had to deposit, and now can't get enough money out for the already delayed sowing."
3," It's like some of the BM hoarders are hiding behind some of the poor, but the government is asking every poor person to prove they are not hiding anything before letting them have their own money. This is stupid."
4, the BM hoarders are finding jugaads and the govt is smart to not implement all rules and 1 upping them with incremental rules. The total BM in cash .... 10% (maximum).
5, the BM hoarders are finding jugaads and the govt is smart to not implement all rules and 1 upping them with incremental rules. That's called lack of vision AND in desi terms being a chutiya to not know such things are possible.
1, Announce first think later
1, LOL. That's how street level thugs operate not the might republic of india
1," Its not a bug, its a feature. /s"
2, Patching on production! We too like to live dangerously!
0, Jan dhan account is opened mainly for poor..if suddenly their accounts have many thousand or lakhs then you need to plan to study that. Many people were questioning how jan dhan accounts which are dormant for some time suddenly getting so much money.now Govt considers their concern and you are talking something else.
1," 50K is the maximum amount you could deposit in a JD account, where are you getting the 'Lakhs' figure from? ""..then you need to plan to study that."" Exactly, you need a plan, not screw with the people with these silly schemes."
1, I've never seen a government brute force anything before. Go India

In a move aimed at protecting the innocent farmers and rural account holders of PMJDY (the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana) from activities of money launderers and legal consequences under the Benami Property Transaction & Money Laundering laws, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has placed a limit of Rs 10,000 on monthly withdrawals from Jan Dhan bank accounts. According to the new notification , the KYC (Know Your Customer)-complaint account holders might be allowed to withdraw Rs 10,000 a month from their account, while branch managers could allow further withdrawals beyond Rs 10,000 within the current applicable limits only after ascertaining the genuineness of such withdrawals and duly documenting them on bank record. On the other hand, the limited or non-KYC-compliant account holders might be allowed to withdraw only Rs 5,000 per month from the amount deposited through specified bank notes after November 9 within the overall ceiling of Rs 10,000. While the RBI has said in its notification that the move is being taken in order to protect farmers and rural account holders, the step is also seen as a measure to contain demand for cash in the system, amid banks and ATMs running dry and people still queueing up to procure valid currency notes.

31,someone actually commented shit like this for real
32,"My grandfather is a hard working man in his 70's. He earned his income through farming, sent his both daughters to schools and colleges. He never asked my mother or my aunt for any money. He is too proud to do that. He borrowed money from his brothers when needed. My mother found way to lend him money through these brothers without him knowing. Doctors found tumors in his mouth just a month back. Finally tobacco caught upto him. Even that didn't make him suck up his ego. He always was a man of his own. He has saved up his savings just for these scenarios. I never witnessed a man stand up to his will for these many years. He is no soldier or a freedom fighter. But he is a fighter alright. I think now is the time he finally has to give up. I was pro demonitization all this time. But I don't want my GODFATHER of a grandfather to roam around the bank manager babus just to get his hard owned money to treat his illness. Even though i know that this is supposed to disable the money launderers, I can't wholeheartedly support this move."
33,"I was pro demonitization all this time. But I don't want my GODFATHER of a grandfather to roam around the bank manager babus just to get his hard owned money to treat his illness. Even though i know that this is supposed to disable the money launderers, I can't wholeheartedly support this move. Am I the only one here who thinks that you were fine this until one of your own landed up into trouble?"
34,Nobody should support this crap. This is flying right in the face of everything the constitution promises.
35,"Dude, if your GPa had 50k in his account, lend him 40,000. Jan Dhan Accounts were not supposed to have more than 50K anyway. If you guys had tons of money lying around in houses, even if that was agri income, you should have filed ITR or at a minimum used a bank acc with a PAN that allows you to pay anyone anytime any amount -- electronically. No excuse now."
36,Won't the RuPay/other debit cards work for paying doctors & other bills?
37,Did your grandfather put his money in Jan dhan account or his regular savings account?
38,"This is a huge ""u so gullible...fuck u..lol"" to all the jan dhan account holders who thought there money was going to be ""safe"" in the bank now."
39,"But but last week everybody was harping on about how all tge money in jan dhan accounts was black money being laundered, and now after this announcement all that money was from poor itself? Thoda kam flip-flop kiya karo"
41,"Thanks. There was never ""tons"" of money lying around anyway. Whatever he earned in one season, he saves some and used the rest for crops for next season. I know he should have used banks right from beginning (like it makes a difference if he has to stand in ATM queues for hours just to withdraw 4k). I am just sad he is being punished for this. It's kind of hard for me to argue with him that it's okay he suffers because us kids would benefit from it in the longer run."
43,Are you outraging on an imagined statement alluding to possible bribery and then coming to some conclusion based of your outrage? Sexy.
45,Well to me cancelling the currency was also borderline unconstitutional. I really didn't know something like this which can alter the course of the nation was completely under govt's control.
46,"I wouldn't say it's crap. But I feel guilty reaping benefits of this demonitization in the long run, whilst it toppled daily lives of many elderly people I care."
47,"It's not scary and you don't have to bribe anyone. Stop spreading FUD. Jandhan was not supposed to accommodate more than 50K. This was very clearly explained since the beginning. If it is agri income exceeding 5000, you should have filed ITR-2A. There are a lot of articulate, rich people FUDing around saying this is unfair to agricultural income population. Well, tough luck, the salaried have been getting beaten with a thick heavy stick for 70 years. EDIT: LOL, the downvotes."
48,"Well, tough luck, the salaried have been getting beaten with a thick heavy stick for 70 years. What fraction of salaried people commit suicide for losing their salary for entire season because of weather issues every year, again?"
49,this is improvising .
51,"Also, once the note is made illegal, the government doesn't have any power to make it legal to use it on petrol pumps/hospitals etc etc. They violated the constitution on a number of issues. All hopes are on the supreme court now. Our opposition is a bunch of idiots."

58,Great decision.Should have kept limit at 4999/-

People speculated that the govt may be slightly disconnected with the ground realities, seems like Modi's hell bent on proving them right."
60,How isn't this fucking illegal? Can the govt decide how much money it'll disburse for the people?Isn't that the account holder's fundamental right?
61,Wasn't the withdrawal limit in PMJDY accounts was Rs 10000 per month to begin with? http://www.allonmoney.com/banking/jan-dhan-yojana-faq/
62,Jan dhan account is opened mainly for poor..if suddenly their accounts have many thousand or lakhs then you need to plan to study that.

64,"If government doesn't change rules fast enough, people complain bureaucracy is lethargic. If government actively tweaks rules, people try to keep a count as though that means something."
65,Now Mamata didi will be even more mad on Modi ji. Highest number of Jan Dhan accounts depositing 50k in their account was from WB.
66,"Now imagine if everything was cashless and the Government imposed such a limit on spending. This is why we shouldn't go cashless. You can be paisaless in minutes, be it due to malice or incompetence."
68,"While everyone supports demonetization including me in general, limiting withdrawals of people's own money is just to hide the fact that there is no cash. I'm in my village and can see people suffer. Also Jandhan accounts are owned by many well to do farmers as they could get it easily."
69,"Modiji, paanch saal ke liye dhanyavaad"
70,"Who opens jan dhan account? poor or unbanked people who have not used banking system Do they use cards for their daily transactions? No, they depend mostly on cash transactions Are all the people having jan dhan accounts participating in hoarding black money? No Do they need more than 10000 per month ? Yes (most prob) So what will happen to them now since they have no cash and max 10k ? fuccccccccccccccked"
71,Drama ban gaya hai bas at this moment. Rich people have converted. Middle class and poor class are fucked. 0 BM hoarders caught. 0 Fake money suppliers caught. What the fucking use even lol
73,I've never seen a government brute force anything before. Go India
75,Jumla Party LUL
76,"India need tax paying citizens not BM generators because of whom we delay our procurement for Forces, or we can only pay rs 300 as old age pension to our citizens. Traders want to deal only in cash or via demand draft. Tomorrow if I like lakhs of people living on rent manage a new 2k note to pay rent in cash, it will bring no benefit to India as it will go into an underground economy. No Landlord wants to accept rent via cheque. And India still suffers."
80,"Abey koi fraction of accounts to genuine honge ya nahi? Logic bhi daan kar diya kya Modiji ke Mandir mein? Why was this so difficult to understand? Nobody said ""all"" Jan dhan accounts were misused. Do you know there is a whole number line between 0 accounts and all accounts?"
83,You have company in the Prime Minister and Finance Minster.
84,"The key objective of Jan Dhan account scheme was financial inclusion. Longer term, this move would instead encourage the poor to voluntarily 'exclude' themselves from the formal banking system. This move has killed the main objective itself. The poor villagers are both supremely naive and wise at the same time. The possibility of government putting restriction on their money would now permanently instill a fear in their mind, and rightly so. Such fears and opinions are formed and broken over generations. It is irrelevant if they have a jan dhan account, whether they use it, whether they have more than 10k in the account or whether they help the money launderers."
85,"That's why these restrictions go hand in hand with unsubstantiated rumors like the government will put 10,000 in every account and so on. The poor may or may not trust the system, but they will hold on to their hopes that they will get their free money someday."
88,Announce first think later
89,It's so refreshing to see the same 5-6 handles having orgasm at how awesome the every single new rule introduced by RBI is. And they call everyone else who comments disapprovingly as being spreading propaganda. Oh the irony!
91,LOL. That's how street level thugs operate not the might republic of india
92,"Good job, govt. OTOH, makes me think perhaps all this de-monet drama is due to total collapse of banking system here (financially) , and the rules are made such that people deposit all their liquid cash in bulk, and get repaid in trickles (to inject funds to banks, and to prevent a run on the banks)."
