It'd be great if someone could explain if this interpretation is wrong.",S
"u/TimeStopsInside You have to read that part in continuation of the first half. The imperative words here are ""entered"" into India + ""and"" exempted under. So the entered into India part is the 1st eligibility while ""and exempted under.."" is 2nd eligibility of not being treated as illegal immigrant. Both conditions must be fulfilled to not be treated as an illegal immigrant. The statement ""any rule or order made thereunder"" is a standard statement added in order to enable future ease of change but rules cannot be read independently, they have to be read in context of the clause they represent & here the clause is the first condition of the proviso about entering into India before 31.12.2014 which HAS to be fulfilled. How many current non Muslims citizens ""entered"" into India before 31.12.14? The act would only be a benefit to those u can prove they entered India & majority of our population did not. So non Muslims are not being given any bullet proof jacket through this Act. Plus, NRC will have a separate list of documents to prove citizenship. The interpretation provided in the article is just conjecture. That statement is very standard legal language & not fishy. The article itself mentions: one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh Even if we were to hypothesize that condition of ""religious persecution"" will be removed, the condition of migrant cannot coz it is present in the original law as the first condition. Edit: sorry meant to tag OP u/crossang",U

"Are there any refugees from these faiths in India from Pak/BD/Afg? As per cutoff date of 31st Dec and IB records the official number of people are 31,313. Its not just 31,313.

Of these, 15 lakh are Hindus which can avail immediate citizenship through CAA, but the rest can't, even if they are genuine Indian citizens. They don't have to prove they were religiously persecuted, only claim that they were, and they would become citizens under CAA. It would be the same problem if and when a countrywide NRC is applied. No matter what documents are required or what the cut-off date is mentioned, there would still be those who don't have them. Then the people belonging to the 6 religions mentioned in CAA could potentially get citizenship through CAA, but the rest won't.",U
"Thanks for your response. I had some counter-points to some of your arguments: I get your point on the benefactors being given govt subsidies etc. I am not suggesting that the weren't persecuted, or that they don't deserve citizenship. I just feel that if this was the purpose of the act, it should be extended to every refugee facing persecution. For example, the Rohingyas living as refugees too could be included for them to get govt benefits. By introducing such a law, aren't we sort of comparing the hardships of one community against hardships of another? Coming to the NE, I know that certain parts of NE have already been exempted by ILP or 6th schedule, but the people of Assam are demanding that their ENTIRE state be exempted from the law.

"I agree the article is filled with conjectures hence why I highlighted this particular clause that caught my interest. You emphasized 'entered into India' as a mandatory eligibility factor. A few questions for it: Who's liable to prove entry? The person or the government? What'll be an eligible proof of entry (assuming worst case scenario of a person with no documentation)? Would you say that 'entered into India' holds the same meaning in the extract I've quoted below from Citizenship Act 1955 ? It seems to me it's an explanatory term rather than an eligibility criteria. Extract: 2.(1)(b) ‚Äúillegal migrant‚Äùmeans a foreigner who has entered into India‚Äï(i) without a valid passport or other travel documents and such other document or authority as may be prescribed by or under any law in that behalf; Next, regarding the similar emphasis on 'migrant', assuming a personal has no documentation to prove his nationality, how can you possibly prove him/her to be a foreigner? Hence, I think foreigner is an explanatory term as well, not an eligibility criteria. Side-note: Do you happen to know if any prominent law scholars have discussed this point?",N

"There are several conditions that determine if you're citizen or not. Most of us wouldn't have to worry a bit, because we easily qualify. (If you've learnt how to calculate income tax through formal education, I think you would get what I'm saying. It's not exactly like that but you'll get an idea.) With CAA, there won't be any changes to citizenship or anything related to it for Indian citizens. With NRC, the government may introduce criteria, which based on the last FAQ (which no one knows if it was official) it shouldn't be a problem for any Indian citizens. And if the NRC is done for the entire country, then the criteria should (and mostly will) be a lot easier, than the NRC done in Assam.",N
"I'm against CAA for a simple reason- there are too many people in India as it is. We should be focussing on our own problems instead of acting out of sympathy to whoever is being persecuted somewhere. We need to stop being bleeding hearts. However, I'm pro NRC though (by the same logic). If you are not a citizen of India, then you need to go back.",U
"I think that's a respectable and valid opinion. However, I do not share the same thoughts.",N
"Why does the CAA does not mention the term ‚ÄòPersecution based on religion‚Äô? From the Assam NRC 1.9 million people were left out, where 1.3 million are Hindus, now the Hindus will be granted citizenship using CAA (since the act does not say to provide citizenship only if the applicants are persecuted based on religion) and the remaining 0.6 millions people which are Muslim will be declared illegal immigrant. This is what I understand. Am I missing something here? Can anyone reply to this and clear out the doubts?",U
"Why does the CAA does not mention the term ‚ÄòPersecution based on religion‚Äô? From my understanding, mentioning ""persecution based on religion"" allows the law to be open ended and the makes it flexible to individuals interpretation. I personally think that laws should be as specific as possible, and leave as little room towards individual interpretation (exceptions are there to this though, but that's not the topic). Am I missing something here? 1.3 million which have entered before the cut off date will be given*. The rest will probably be deemed as illegal immigrants. Can anyone reply to this and clear out the doubts? What was your doubt again?",S

"TLDR - Summary of most objections to CAA Not against accepting minorities but against linking CAA with NRC. Fear that BJP will ride rough shod over all objections and implement NRC the way they want and probably dismiss minority sentiments. Finally, the sheer arrogance and brutality with which the govt has responded to objections and opposition has scared everyone that India is turning into a Fascist state. The problem in short is that BJP is implementing this law.",U
BJP has miserably failed in implementing multiple policies. I have my doubts.,N

"CAA solely ig good and that should have been done long ago but when you combine with NRC it becomes difficult,tbh it looks straight from BJP hand book to polarize. Amit shah had himself said there is no need to provide documents for them then the indian citizen who is hindu can escape that water but what about muslims. I also think they are doing this for their vote bank in Assam. When you reply please dont say NRC hasn't been discussed anywhere,that would deplore this conversation.",S

"No, the logic is if they are being persecuted they deserve refuge. The notion that a Muslim cannot be persecuted in a Islamic nation is absurd. Malala Yousafzai had to flee her country. Several Germans were against the Nazi regime, who also needed refuge. Statements like this are simply ignorant.",N
Was she targeted because she was speaking against Islam or against the terrorists residing in Pakistan? How many times she has spoken against the persecution of minorities and condemn the religious bigots in her own country? How ignorant you are to not to see the difference between the two. Also how many Sunni Islamic people you have come across who spoken out against persecution in the countries where they themselves are in majority?,N

"The answers that are pro CAA are being brigaded from a pro Hindutva sub, r/IndiaSpeaks. https://np.reddit.com/r/indiaspeaks/comments/eefhux/_/ OP: there are opposing views on this bill, but it boils down to the fact that one group considers India as a Hindu state, the other considers India as a pluralistic, secular democracy. This bill is dangerously close to setting a precedent of making Indian citizenship based on religion, and a lot of people are uncomfortable with this. Yes, nothing is set in stone right now, so the NRC could be wholly inclusive, but the ruling political party has been voted to power on their pro Hindu, borderline anti Muslim rhetoric. Personal opinion, but it is also a way to distract from the real issues like rising food prices, unemployment and a sluggish economy.",U
Good job dude,N
"Muslims from these 3 countries weren't included in this act as they don't face any problems in these ""Islamic states"". This is not true, as there are subsections within Muslims, and conflicts do arise between them. Even if that was the case, that is Muslims actually do not face any problems, then the Muslims does not have to be excluded explicitly by the law. I mean, what is the logic in explicitly forbidding something that is not going to happen any way? So that is discrimination based on religion, and thus should not be allowed to be part of the constitution.",U

If they would have understood this simply there would be no mess like it is now. And i am surprised there is no other explanation coming out of any commie till now.,N
"Answer: Attempting to explain why people are protesting, i.e. how they see the events/bill: CAA or the Citizenship Amendment Act is the first bill (now passed into law) where citizenship to India is linked to the religion of the person applying for citizenship. Protestors see this as an affront to the secular nature of India (Preamble to the Constitution of India reads: ""We, the People of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic."") CAA is being linked to the NRC or the National Register of Citizens. While the NRC has not been tabled or passed yet, the Home Minister clearly said in Parliament that it is going to be done. The Prime Minister is now back-tracking claiming there is no discussion of NRC despite the Home Ministers clear assertions in Parliament. A state version of the NRC was done in the border state of Assam as there are many undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh in Assam. The result left 1.9 million people off the Citizenship Register, the registration required burdensome documentation including proof of residence of yourself or your ancestors before 1971, and it cost a lot of money. While no documentation details of a nationwide NRC have been officially released, people fear they may not have or be able to provide documents if the requirements are stringent. India has hundreds of millions of poor and illiterate people, they will likely be the ones most affected if lots of documents are required. To summarise the fear of the people in the linking of the CAA (a bill passed into law) and the NCR (not officially passed or tabled yet): The NRC will likely delist millions of predominantly poor people who will lose their citizenship and voting rights. This will include Hindus, Muslims and other religions. 2)After the delisting, the CAA will allow the Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist who have been left off the NRC to apply as refugees living in India and be fast-tracked to Indian Citizenship. While not allowing this same process for the Muslims left off of the NRC. The end result being a disenfranchising of predominantly Muslims. Note: The reason the state of Assam is protesting the CAA is different to the reasons of most of India. Assam has a high undocumented immigrant population from Bangladesh. They fear the CAA offering citizenship to many of these immigrants will make the ethnically Assamese a minority in their own state and lead to the erosion of their distinct language and culture. To re-iterate: I am explaining the reasons many are protesting, not claiming the legitimacy of their fears or whether they are true, right, or wrong.",U
On what legal grounds do they stand for excluding muslims on the application?,N
"Why is citizenship important? I mean, in India specifically, why would you fear not being a citizen? Only because of voting?",N
"because religious persecution (inter-religious) and sectarian persecution (intra-religious) are different.. By definition, sectarian persecution is a subset of religious persecution, so anything that fall under sectarian persecution should fall under religious persecution, which renders that argument/answer invalid.",N
"Answer: In a nutshell: India is a secular nation. Constitution clearly says so. The current BJP government has passed a bill to provide citizenship for immigrants on the basis of religion, excluding just the Muslims. And the government is known for their notorious religious extremism (hindutva) and ill-founded nationalism. I can site lot of hate crimes against minorities (especially Muslims), lot of government policies drafted just to favour Hindutva and actual quotes from their leaders wanting the country to be a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Country). Hence, people are riled up because they see this as BJP's initial steps in wiping out all other religions in the country, basically throwing out the all secular and plural values, which makes India, well, India.",U
"On the basis of being members of a religion that is persecuted in their home countries. That's why the law specifies countries of origin and religion. It's a known con-flux of persecution. So, if a nation passed a law granting easy citizenship requirements to Jews in the 1940's, would that violate any secular principals that nation may claim?",N
"The persecution of muslims in Myanmar and China was in fact much more sanctioned by the govt than those of minorities in Pakistan. BJP is famous for using the letter of the law to break the spirit of the law. A recent example was Article 370. By our constitution it could only have been revoked with the cooperation of the J&K govt, but BJP took the opportunity when J&K didn't have a functioning govt to scrap it almost unilaterally. I see each of your justifications and see the same pedantic excuses. 3. CAA is not like SC/ST reservations. It's like if we gave reservations to all but one ST tribe even though they face the same persecution from upper caste Hindus that others do.",S
"And also, just to add to the top comment, the main reason the CAA is being criticised is because of the ambiguity in its enforcement, which can mean that the powers that be can now legally evict minorities out of the nation. These protests have lately taken a turn for the worse, and are getting increasingly violent. The scale and nature of these protests is leading it to become somewhat similar to the situation in Hong Kong, and at this point, it seems like the government is suppressing dissent. For example, in Mangalore, located in South Karnataka, two people were killed by police firing, and in Bangalore, the silicon valley of India, permission has been granted to hold Pro-CAA protests today, 23/12/19, but the same has been denied to anti-CAA protests. This is being perceived by many as the government being biased, as the ruling party at the centre is also in power in the state of karnataka. While we cannot completely say that the ruling party is indeed suppressing dissent, it's is quite plausible, keeping in mind the events that have transpired in many metropolitan areas of India.",S
"Not relevant to what OP asked but had to be said, India isn‚Äôt truely secular. Secular means Uniform Civil Code which India doesn‚Äôt have. Hopefully the current ‚Äòhindutva‚Äô govt will pass it. That would really be secular now wouldn‚Äôt it?",N
"That's a start but India really needs a change in attitude. Hindus, Muslims... everyone. Hating on your fellow man because they are a different religion can't lead to a truly secular society.",U
"India is truly secular, it's right there in the constitution. I'm fine with implementing the Uniform Civil Code which will take us one step further in making our secular values concrete. Can you oppose CAA on the same basis? Just accept it and move on - you and your brethren do not want India to be secular. Saves both of our time.",S
"Thanks for taking tome to write this. I am all for CAB, however, there are many more questions that are raised, which is why people think it is anti-Muslim. 1: Why are only Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan including? You don‚Äôt need to be an ‚ÄúIslamic Republic‚Äù to persecute minorities 2. Why is religious persecution the main element of this? Countries are also persecuting minorities based on non religious ethnic identities. See China and Myanmar now, and earlier Sri Lanka with the Tamils. You could argue that all 3 of these countries are/ were fighting separatist movements and hence it is a temporary political issue, and not a long term permanent persecution. But I have not seen this argument made yet. 3. Why exclude Ahmadis in Pakistan? Yes, India might see them as Muslims, but within Pakistan, they are not seen as Muslims, and persecuted as non Muslims. Maybe even worse than other religious minorities! It would have been better to just come out straight and recognize that India is the birth place of Dharmic religions and that we have a duty of care to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists around the world. And thus India will offer our help to them whenever possible. It doesn‚Äôt mean Indian Muslims are second class citizens, but it is a recognition of our cultural history.",S
Might get downvoted. But as an Ahmadi I appreciate you calling out point 3. I'm indian but most of my friends are Pakistani and I have some pakistani family. So many of them have been touched by the horrid persecution that's more or less endorsed by the government.,N
"To answer your first question, I think it is because of the countries that border India, those three are defined as Islamic in their constitutions, while others (Nepal, Bhutan) have secular constitutions. I personally think myanmar should be included, as they say they are Buddhist in their constitution.",N
Answer: Adding one more point to u/waeva's comment: A Muslim Pakistan was carved out of India as a home for Muslims of the country. Millions of non-Muslim refugees made their way to India and were given Indian citizenship. However persecution of non-Muslims continues till today in Pakistan so India should be seen as a natural home for the non-Muslims of Pakistan. This act could be seen as an extension of that partition.,N
"Muslim Pakistan was carved out of India as a home for Muslims of the country. No, it was carved out for those who wanted to live in a Islamic republic. There were millions of Muslims who voluntarily stayed back in India. Saying India is a home for only Non-muslims goes against the secular values of our country.",N
why is this comment being downvoted .?,N
"You're forgetting about NRC. That's one of the biggest reasons people are pissed about this, because in combination with the CAB it's basically a way for the government to ruin the lives of a huge amount of Muslims (a group the government has expressed hatred for, with multiple members of the party being part of major anti-Muslim groups and being involved in anti-Muslim riots) while giving people from basically every other major religion in India a get-out-of-jail-free card. Edit: Here's a comment that explains the rest of the context which the original commenter has ingeniously ignored: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/eee5en/whats_up_with_india_against_caa/fbttmc7?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",U
"I have a doubt. I have seen some videos which claim that CAA will not help the non muslims who couldn't prove their citizenship as they will have to prove that they came from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh and that they suffered through religious persecution. If the people can't even give simple documents, how can they proof something thats not even true? NRC is gonna fuck the poor and illiterate irrespective of the religion as they won't be able to access CAA. Thus, discrimination on the basis of CAA+NRC sounds pretty non existent to me. The YouTube channel called ""The open letter"" made the video i m talking about. Please clear my confusion.",U
"You are right about the problem of getting documents, but please watch the below video and try to understand what the actual implementation will be like. If you are from India or have any experience with how the country works, you will know that what is written law and what actually happens is quite different. Hopefully this cleared your confusion on why people are protesting. https://twitter.com/i/status/1207263602148724736",N
"I'm sorry but this is blatantly false. I don't know if you're genuinely misinformed or here to spread BJP propaganda, but the CAA doesn't just 'reduce the waiting time for citizenship from the usual 11 years to 5 years for Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh/Parsi/Christian refugees'. Your period of residence in the country would only be considered if you entered the country legally, and you are then granted citizenship on grounds of naturalization, for which, like you said, the waiting time has been reduced from 11 years to 5 years for Hindus etc. Before the amendment, you simply could not become an Indian citizen if you were an illegal immigrant, but the most crucial aspect of the amendment, which this post completely misses, is that if you are an illegal Hindu/Christian/Sikh immigrant, you would automatically be granted the status of a legal immigrant, and you can then gain citizenship based on the reduced naturalization period.",N
"I don‚Äôt think any country would be okay with granting citizenship to illegal immigrants. Refugees? Sure, makes sense. Illegal immigrants? Nope",S
wow..that clarified so many things I didn't see such a justification in r/India. Why are some ppl still protesting?,N
"Their PM said that western ideas of human rights do not apply to India, so there is probably some disconnect it what they say is happening and what is actually happening.",N
"There is one crucial part of this post which is factually incorrect. Before CAA, there was no pathway for any illegal immigrant to get Indian citizenship (regardless of religion). So, if a Muslim is not on the NRC list then they will be declared an illegal immigrant and have no safety net to remain in India. Their ""wait time"" is not increased, they are declared illegal immigrants and will be sent to detention centers. In fact even those belonging to any other religion will have to prove that they came from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, or Pakistan. Another thing to consider is how much of a mess the NRC has been in Assam. Doing it nationwide will be a nightmare. There is also the cost of doing this, 1200 crore just for Assam means massive spending for this exercise.",N
"This is a very biased answer, it doesn't even touch on the NRC and how, Muslims living in India before the seperation of Pak-Bang 1971 need to prove they lived their, if they can't prove it whether or not they have been living there, their citizenship is revoked. Take a look at the post history. Now people in the very",N
"Wait, I may just be a naive American, but I thought Bangladesh was majority Hindu. Isn't that why they broke away from Pakistan? They were originally ""East Pakistan"", which was an exclave of Pakistan, after the original partition of India upon independence from Britain after all.",N
None whatsoever. That's the issue.,N
State propaganda alert!!! There is no mention of NRC in this and that the protests are more about CAA+NRC than CAA alone. u/sidvicc is on point with his explanation.,N

"Couple of questions with context- India has always been a secular nation (atleast constitutionally) and if Muslims are not persecuted in the neighbouring countries - why not include them too? Give them also an option to move here legally. Reasons could be many - India is more liberal with Muslim and hindu laws as compared to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Washington post and other news outlets - yes they have posted a few times terrorist sympathetic articles - but that does not give a certainty that they are pro terrorism. If you look at their history, they have constantly published articles and discussion in stopping terrorism and specifically ISIS. Ps. These are just questions and not hate questions. Just a normal discussion with no intention of only being proven right but - to get a better understanding. To add - I feel the riots could have been planned by the BJP as a shit show for losing elections. Because if they wanted to - they could have contained it within hours as they hold the police and yes, to a certain extent, the army",N

"Great effort in collecting all the facts, they are really helpful. But, the problem is the government is fucked up in conveying what's the deal of it. Modi declines that there isn't any discussion on NRC and NPR while Amit Shah has mentioned it in almost every public meeting. If the government can write down everything what's gonna happen in NRC and NPR, what are the documents necessary to prove citizenship and print it in all the major newspapers and tv channels, it will be reassuring. The major cause of these riots is lack of proper communication between govt and people. That sucks!",U

"CAA Gives Citizenship To Illegal Immigrants. I would like to correct your this statement CAA Gives Citizenship To RELIGIOUSLY PRESECUTED MINIORITIES who can be illegal immigrants.. what the term ""religiously presecuted"" does ... is that it cuts down the number by a lot.. not everyone who comes here is persecuted.. most of the people especiialy in assam are bangladeshi muslims... who are neither persecuted nor included in CAA.. So they Wont be given Citizenship .. Criteria of defining ""Religious Persecution "" is very tough.. Thanks for bringing this Up I will Add This in the Post.. And... Here's A link explaining that criteria",S
There is no such mention anywhere on papers. NRC excluded about a million Hindus. Are you saying all of them won't get citizenship ? Is there any official documentation saying so ? Because Sonowal and Himanta have been claiming otherwise in their rallies.,U

Honestly I wouldnt Like Rohingyas to Be taken Refugees here because of their history of constant violence and pushing their idealogy on other people.. No one can guarantee they wouldnt cause same trouble here that they caused in Myanmar.. On the other hand i do believe Not everyone of those rohingyas will be this much extremist.. But you cant also Risk the security of your people.. by taking them in.. With CAA Only Communities from Pakistan, bangladesh and Afghanistan are allowed.. They Share a lot in common with us..our cultures are almost same..it will be easy for them to adapt/settle herea and our citizens to accept them while rohingyas on other hand doesnt share as much..",S

The Assam NRC was a disaster, where ex Army people were also left out. How are we sure that a nation wide NRC would not be faulty ? The error rate of Adhaar itself was around 9%. Going into the economics of this, how can we prove that this exercise would solve any problem ? The cost of the Assam NRC was a whopping 1200 crores. Scale that to the entire country which is around 40 times the size of Assam, it would cost 48000 crores ! India‚Äôs current GDP output is 2.6 lakh crores. Why are we wasting so much money just to identify 3 crore illegal immigrants ?",U

"First of all the protesting is not wrong. Anyone can protest for anything and that is their basic right. The protests started as a peaceful protest and somehow changed to violent ones.

"Add a strong point to the - 'secular fabric of India':- As Affirmative Action aka reservation is based on the criteria of religion, caste and tribe, as people were oppressed on these very criteria, in the same manner CAA is using religion, as it's the very criteria of oppression in neighbouring countries. If laws like reservation don't disrupt the secularity of India, despite the fact of it being based on the differentiation by caste, creed and religion, then CAA also don't disrupt the secular fabric of India Also OP don't mention any points on NRC and NPR as there are no formal drafts for it, and the points sounds less authentic without it. Edit 1:- Also OP mention a similar act passed in the US Congress without any upheaval:- The Religious Persecution Relief Act, 2016 of the United States declares, ""Syrian nationals who are religious minorities in their country of origin: shall be classified as refugees of special humanitarian concern, shall be eligible for priority two processing under the refugee resettlement priority system..."" https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2708 https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s2708/summary",S

Army should not be responsible for employment.,S
"FYI, City boys aren't even competing to join grade B jobs that Agnipath scheme offers. The normal recruitment (Recruitment before Agnipath Scheme was launched) that used to take place used to happen in rural India. The recruits get commissioned as Jawans, Air Men or Sailors in the Army, IAF and Navy respectively. So, it is a very rare case that someone from the city will join or prepare to join the Tri-services through Agnipath Scheme.",S
Understood. Thank you very much,N
"When there are thousands of vacancies in the army, the government comes up with this contractual scheme. The outrage isn‚Äôt surprising. After completion of the contract, people may end up with menial jobs and some might even choose to indulge in antisocial activities. Most importantly, 6 months isn‚Äôt enough for army training.",U
"It's the retention criteria that is quite concerning as only a selective lot (25%) would be allowed to continue to serve in the forces while the rest would be let go. I also feel this may add more pressure for the officers as the officer-JCO/ORs ratio is skewed in every regiment and naturally the rejected cohort of Agniveers would lose their morale in the last year of their employment in the forces. I've heard that initially General Bipin Rawat had proposed this scheme for Officer level personnel as well. Apparently, the idea is to cut down the pension bill of the armed forces. But they have rolled it out only for JCOs and ORs levels for now. So, in case this scheme turns out to be a success, it could be rolled out for officers in the future too.",N
For 2 years normal recruitment have been put on hold citing covid. This year they were expecting 2-3 worth of recruitment. They got this instead.,U
I believe they canceled lot of normal recruitment exams in this year and suggested candidates to apply through Agniveer/Agnipath scheme. At least least this is what the students protesting in Hyderabad have been saying. This triggered a lot of the protests as students who were preparing for years and even cleared the physical exams as well felt robbed of the opportunities which available right before Agnipath policy announcements,U
"The goal of pension bill reduction works only if agniveer is the normal mode of recruitment. Nowhere in the original MoD press release did they indicate that regular recruitment will go on. In any case, there has been no regular recruitment since March 2022 and now also, there is no indication of resumption of regular recruitment",N
"You are 630,65,369 potential candidate for post of UP CM",N
These are supposed to be extra jobs I think. I heard it on a news channel so I can't be sure but I don't understand what's the problem with extra jobs. The normal hiring will continue as they used to,N
Normal hiring has stalled for many years.,N
The Agnipath scheme has been mooted with the primary objective of reducing the wage and pension burden on the government. Do you think these will be extra jobs in this context? Are you aware that the usual hiring has been frozen for a couple of years?,U
I don‚Äôt think ‚Äòjobs‚Äô are ever extra.,N
I just tune in to Chessbase India.,N
"In the earlier system, troops joined in for 17 years, which could be extended for certain personnel. 17 years meant a permanent job, pension after retirement and entitlement to different allowances etc. In new system, the duration of service would be 4 years only and retention would be 25% (people who would serve beyond 4 years). This system is NOT optional and all officers below officer ranks would be now selected through this route ONLY. Hence the protest.",N
So goverment spent money and recources training a future soldier and that soldier desperately wants to work in that job but being chucked out coz only 25% would be retained . All the skills that person learned is maybe useless in another field so that person has to start a another career from scratch all over again .,U
Unemployment.,N
Indian economy isn‚Äôt sufficient enough to sustain the army under NDA government. That‚Äôs why there have been no recruitments since many years. There have been no recruitment in state and central owned industries for this very reason.,N
