1,This is a one time amnesty scheme. These people can still apply for citizenship through normal route.
2,4 lakh Tamil Hindus were given what you ask for between 1960 & 2010 - source MHA
3,"Nepalis already have freedom of movement with India since 1950 when the 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship was signed. Article 7 of this Treaty states: Article 7The Governments of India and Nepal agree to grant, on a reciprocal basis, to the nationals of one country in the territories of the other the same privileges in the matter of residence, ownership of property, participation in trade and commerce, movement and other privileges of a similar nature. Since many liberals love The Hindu, here is an excerpt from an article from The Hindu: The treaty provides for an open border between the two countries and allows Nepali nationals to work in India without a work permit, to apply for government jobs and the civil services (except for the IFS, IAS, and IPS), to open bank accounts and buy property. Note that Indians aren't allowed to own land-properties or work in government institutions in Nepal but India has allowed Nepali citizens to do so. The Indo-Nepal border is open; Nepalese and Indian nationals may move freely across the border without passports or visas and may live and work in either country. Meaning, any Nepali citizen can come and stay in India without a visa/refugee document. So why include Nepali Christians in CAA when the Indian Law already allows it? China occupied Tibet. Tibet now has a government-in-exile. Do you know where it is? It is in India. Ever heard of the Dalai Lama? Is he a Hindu from Pakistan/Bangladesh? Tibetans were given and are still given status in India. The problem is that the Tibetan government in exile does not want Tibetans to take Indian citizenship. If they do so, this weakens their idea of a Free Tibet country. Tamilians – others have already addressed this issue in other comments. But you question Tamil Hindus not being included, correct? So, you agree this CAA isn't pro-Hindu and anti-Muslims. So the law is anti-Hindus too. Hence the ""Hindu rashtra"" and all other such theories are lies. Makes sense?"
4,"Sri Lanka was not part of the 1947 partition, neither was Nepal or China. Why do people deny the direct connection between 1947 'religious' based partition and CAA? People willfully suppress the Nehru-Liaquat pact which is the forerunner of CAA. That said, 6 lakh Tamil Hindus have been given citizenship in the last decade."
6,"I mean are their struggles not equal to refugees from pak,bangladesh ? Why have them wait for 11 years while the others can get it for 5"

9,"Cross commenting from a similar post (with slight moderations). Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong anywhere. 1.Since CAA applies to giving citizenship and not refuge, why is there a need to fast-track the naturalization process for only some communities? I would understand the argument that these minorities do not have anywhere else to go to (though I think it has flaws too, but I'll get to it later), but remember, we aren't talking about giving humanitarian respite to these communities, refuge is already provided to them, we are only giving them citizenship. So why do some communities deserve voting rights and other citizenship rights faster than others? I think the govt’s priorities should be on economy and infra rather than passing a law that isn’t even helping its own citizens but rather forcing them to protest, which again does negative contribution to the economy. These protesters could have been working/studying if only the govt would reach out and address their issues (especially regarding the link b/w CAA and NRC) 2. Coming to the argument that there are 150 or so Islamic states, but only 1 country for Hindus/ other communities: -This is factually incorrect- Nepal also has a majority Hindu population -We must remember that India is a secular democracy, so any particular community has as much ""right"" over India as it has over any other secular democracy (US or Canada for example). So in fact these persecuted minorities ALSO have ~100 other secular countries to go to (That is not to say that they aren't welcome in India, but that they are only as welcome as in any other secular nation) -By this argument, Christians also have many other countries that they can go to, so why include them ? 3. On the argument that persecution of Ahmadiyyas and Shias shouldn't be classified as ""religious"", since they are within the same religious denomination ie. their persecution is ""sectarian"": -Pakistan's state religion is SUNNI ISLAM, hence the Shias are in my understanding not under the state religion. So why is persecution of other minorities with different religion than that of State considered religious, but their persecution sectarian? -The Ahmadiyyas in Pakistan are OFFICIALLY recognized as NON-MUSLIMS, so their religion is again different than that of State, in fact, they are not even within the same religious denomination according to Pakistani law, so the above question also applies to them. 4. Why are other religious minorities- Atheists, Jews, followers of Baha'i faith etc. not included in the law? 5. A frequent argument is why not include Tamil Hindus and Muslim in Sri Lanka, to which a frequent response is that their situation has improved over the past years. But the same could be said for Afghanistan, which has seen more religious freedom post-Taliban, so why include them? 6. To the argument that only Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are included because they have an official state religion: Why not include Bhutan? Bhutan too has an official state religion- Vajrayana Buddhism. In fact, other religious groups in Bhutan weren’t allowed to publicity practice their faiths until 2007. 7. If the purpose of this law is to provide respite to religiously persecuted minorities, why hasn’t the term “religious persecution” been mentioned anywhere in the official draft? 8. There has been no addressing or even acknowledgement of protests in Assam by the govt. Govt has failed to give them any reassurance that they will be exempted from CAA. IMO it seems like the govt has turned its face away from NE protests to address mainland protests because they are easier to counter. There’s also the whole issue I have with NRC, especially its link with CAA, but I’m gonna digress because you only asked about CAA. EDIT: My first gold, thanks kind redditor!"
10,"fast-track the naturalization process for only some communities It's to those who have been persecuted by the people from the 3 countries mentioned. I think the govt’s priorities should be on economy and infra To be honest economy, infrastructure, healthcare, education etc should always be at the centre of attention. However this doesn't mean that the government cannot do anything other than what will help education, infrastructure etc. We aren't robots. If tomorrow, the government is hosting republic day with the help of tax payers money, I don't think it's wrong at all, just because it does not contribute in any major way and infact uses tax payers money on celebration. (I know this point is a little extreme, but please understand what I'm trying to say rather than getting pedantic about it.) These protesters could have been working/studying The government never calls for people to protest. Citizens decide if they want to protest or not. reach out and address their issues (especially regarding the link b/w CAA and NRC) Other than thatThey have started so many rallies, door to door campaigns to bust the myths associated. Moreover with the fake news that is being circulated it is sad to see the journalists being biased as much as they have. Coming to the argument that there are 150 or so Islamic states, but only 1 country for Hindus/ other communities: I agree with this, and understand that it is not a valid argument. 3. On the argument that persecution of Ahmadiyyas and Shias shouldn't be classified as ""religious"", since they are within the same religious denomination ie. their persecution is ""sectarian"": Being practical about this (correct me if I'm wrong). There are more than 83 versions/classifications (maybe a lot more than that as well) of Islam/Muslims. Even within Shia Muslims, there are tons of classifications. It's always easy to divide a group into sub groups and further sub groups and then establish that a particular sub-sub group has been persecuted. This can go on forever. And it would be easy for any group of people to divide themselves as a sub group and claim to be persecuted. Hence for practical reasons, I believe there should be a boundary drawn (I understand, deciding where to draw the boundary could be highly subjective, so that also tells you that there isn't any wrong or right answer). 4. Why are other religious minorities- Atheists, Jews, followers of Baha'i faith etc. not included in the law? From my understanding, the persecution has been targeted specifically to certain groups. You can always claim that these people were also being persecuted in the country (which could be right) but there should be a boundary drawn. If not then, based on the same argument you could take refugee from anywhere in the world based on any religion, caste, race, etc which sounds ethical, but it's not at all practical. But the same could be said for Afghanistan How are you even saying that security situation is same in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. There were about 6-8 Lakhs people who belonged to those 6 religions during partition. Now there are 500 of them remaining. What happened to the rest 99.9375% of the people? Again, I'm probably not the right person to comment on this, but to my understanding the two countries portray scenarios that have major differences. 6. To the argument that only Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are included because they have an official state religion: Why not include Bhutan? Bhutan too has an official state religion- Vajrayana Buddhism. In fact, other religious groups in Bhutan weren’t allowed to publicity practice their faiths until 2007. I'm not aware if people are being abducted, raped, killed or made to convert their religion by force, in Bhutan. If so then I completely support this point. religious persecution” been mentioned anywhere in the official draft? Don't you think this makes the entire term subjective? 8. There has been no addressing or even acknowledgement of protests in Assam by the govt. Yes, I personally think this is a problem. However I don't think it's for the entire north east as they have provisions of ILP. There’s also the whole issue I have with NRC, especially its link with CAA, but I’m gonna digress because you only asked about CAA. Thank you for this. Coming on to another point - why aren't Rohingya Muslims being taken. I had this question as well, for which I was answered with many points, which made me convince why they were exempted but I still have my doubts regarding this. If asked I would need some more time to answer to further research and find out more about this. Lastly, thank you for your opinion. I think I've answered to the best of my knowledge, and I personally don't think there could be major errors factually on what I've said (I still could be wrong though), other than opinions, which can be either way, right or wrong, and there's no right way to decide that."
11,"Ok, its a long post but I'll try to respond to most points. Of course, we will disagree on many or most of them but here it goes - why is there a need to fast-track the naturalization process for only some communities?  refuge is already provided to them, we are only giving them citizenship. Please watch some interviews of refugee families. They need the legal status to avail various Govt schemes/ school admissions etc. Without being a citizen, they can not get any of Govt benefits. Their lives have been saved but now is the question of their livelihood. I think the govt’s priorities should be on economy and infra rather than passing a law that isn’t even helping its own citizens but rather forcing them to protest Of course, Govt needs to focus on economy & infra but its not Govt which is forcing people to protest. People are mostly protesting out of their own misinformation/agenda/speculations. So in fact these persecuted minorities ALSO have ~100 other secular countries to go to. Yes, but they were part of India (please don't tell me there was no India before British). Even the NWFP areas had fluid borders so that's why 6 minority religions of Pak/Bang/Afg were included in CAA. When division of country happened, they were suddenly declared non-Indians without having any say and left in a place where they were persecuted ""because of their religion"" from day zero. It's extremely difficult for them to move to other secular western countries than India. Pakistan's state religion is SUNNI ISLAM, hence the Shias are in my understanding not under the state religion. So why is persecution of other minorities with different religion than that of State considered religious, but their persecution sectarian? Pakistan's state religion is Islam. Where did you read that its sunni-Islam? In any case, Jinnah was a Shia so I don't think he would exclude Shias from state religion. Both Shias and Ahmadis were at forefront in demand for Pakistan on ""religious lines."" So how can they turn now and say grant us Indian citizenship? They are not being persecuted because of their religion. They're not being forced to convert nor their daughters being raped/abducted/converted on daily basis. They can get Indian citizenship on case-by-case basis via normal process. Why are other religious minorities- Atheists, Jews, followers of Baha'i faith etc. not included in the law? Are there any refugees from these faiths in India from Pak/BD/Afg? As per cutoff date of 31st Dec and IB records the official number of people are 31,313. source Out of which - Hindus - 25,447 Sikhs - 5,807 Christians - 55 Buddhists - 2 Pasis - 2 There are 0 Jains left in Pak/BD/Afg. But the same could be said for Afghanistan, which has seen more religious freedom post-Taliban, so why include them? Answered above. Also, the SL Tamils and Myanmar Hindus are not included because they were never part of greater India. Of course, if Govt decides to include them in future, we will again be back here discussing it. Why not include Bhutan? Again, because Bhutan was not part of India. People from Bhutan were never promised to be included in India by Gandhi/Nehru/Rajendra Prasad etc. why hasn’t the term “religious persecution” been mentioned anywhere in the official draft? Its implicit but yes, it could have been officially included. I am not sure why it wasn't included in text. There has been no addressing or even acknowledgement of protests in Assam by the govt. Govt has failed to give them any reassurance that they will be exempted from CAA. Its already mentioned in CAA eligibility criteria that refugees to be given citizenship only when its proven that -  they are not in certain tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, or Tripura included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, or areas under the “Inner Line” permit, i.e., Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland. source here"
12,Nepal also has a majority Hindu population Nepal is secular and they also amended their constitution to be secular. So there is technically no Hindu nation in the world. If being Hindu majority is the same as being Hindu nation than India is Hindu nation and we can welcome Hindu refugees from all over the world. Also we are accepting non Muslims from these countries because they violated Nehru liaquat pact and Ambedkar wanted a total population exchange between two countries. Also people were poor back then and travelling 10kms itself was a huge struggle without good transportation so if there were many people who wanted to come to India but couldn't make it.
13,"Regarding your point#4: ""Why are Jews not included?"" This is a non-problem to begin with. You talked about Jews in Pakistan/Afghanistan not being considered here? I ask you: do you even know how many Jews are currently living in Pakistan? And are those few (not even a thousand) who are living there coming to India to seek Indian citizenship? No! Most of them make aliyah instead. Israel is welcoming them with open arms and they prefer to go there. Not because they hate India or anything, but because that's where they would prefer to go to. So why talk about non-issues and make a big issue out of it?"
15,"If the purpose of this law is to provide respite to religiously persecuted minorities, why hasn’t the term “religious persecution” been mentioned anywhere in the official draft? It has..have you read it? There has been no addressing or even acknowledgement of protests in Assam by the govt. Govt has failed to give them any reassurance that they will be exempted from CAA. IMO it seems like the govt has turned its face away from NE protests to address mainland protests because they are easier to counter. You support Assamese trying to preserve their native culture, but not Hindus? Pakistan's state religion is SUNNI ISLAM, hence the Shias are in my understanding not under the state religion. Had the Shias & Ahmediyas not supported the Muslim League in creation of Pak based on ISLAM, not Sunnis? Finally, where is your outrage about what your brothers did to Kashmiri Hindus? Ever fought for their rights? If you are okay with genocide of hindus by muslims, why do we care for you?"
16,"A big reason is you're changing the conferring of citizenship to people based on religion . In India , Citizenship is something that is conferred not on which religion you belong to or what caste you're from . It's something that's done irrespective of all the things that divides and classifies human beings into various starta and sects The CAA is basically changing that you're giving priority treatment to certain sections, you shouldn't do that No one is denying them the right to come or have a visa or anything like that, they can be citizens They just have to follow the rules which are already there when it comes to awarding citizenship . Wait for your naturalistion and you will become citizens . you're not being denied it, just wait for your turn that's all nothing else For there's something like equality that's enshrined in our constitution irrespective of what's your socio economic condition is Also CAA Plus NRC is a bullet that can be laced to target sections of the society especially the poor and marginalized For NRC you need to look at Assam and the chaos it has caused for there's case like where the child is a citizen and the parents are not , one parent is a citizen and the other is not and where one of the parent is a citizen but the child is not and as far as adopted and orphaned children goes i have no idea what has happened in their case NRC doesn't consider voter ID and passport as proof of citizenship, damn it's like passport is something that makes you a citizen of that and is considered by all the other countries that you're a citizen of india and voter ID means that you're eligible to vote . The documents they ask for is something that a whole lot of people in the country don't have Dont get me started on the district magistrate and people who are responsible for doing NRC They had lined their pockets up with bribes in Assam to save people with money and influence and exhorted money from poor and marginalized sections of the society In what world is this fair you tell me You have to pay bribes to save your own ass Lastly it's not what my freedom fighters fought for. They wanted India to be secular and democratic country, not a banana republic where dissent and protest is crushed and people are called anti national just because they opposes them"
17,"In India , Citizenship is something that is conferred not on which religion you belong to or what caste you're from . It's something that's done irrespective of all the things that divides and classifies human beings into various starta and sects The whole country was divided based on religion. A secular state and an Islamic state. I'm not saying that it was right not was it wrong, but it's a fact that it was done that way. Now making amends to that shouldn't seem wrong, but it does to many. priority treatment to certain sections It's given to the 6 religions that were severely persecuted in the neighbouring countries, that have often taken refugee in India because it was the easiest for them to do so, as it was the most accommodative for their religions. And denying that they weren't persecuted is just people being oblivious and ignorant. (4 days ago a gurdwara was attacked, and this is the most recent news that I received.) Also CAA Plus NRC is a bullet Man! NRC isn't even discussed. It could be a potential threat but isn't CAA the main focus. For NRC you need to look at Assam and the chaos That was based on the Assam accord. It wasn't conducted in the best way, that doesn't mean that it was unnecessary. Lastly it's not what my freedom fighters fought for. They wanted India to be secular and democratic country, not a banana republic where dissent and protest is crushed and people are called anti national just because they opposes them I agree. But I also think the rallies against CAA with people uneducated about the situation is too high. Which is something to be said about as well."
18,"Honest question - Do you support SC/ST reservations?If yes, do you realize SC/ST were religiously persecuted minorities (untouchability) ?If yes, do you have a problem with another law which helps religiously persecuted minorities (CAA) ?"
19,"citizenship to people based on religion False, we are giving citizenship based on religious persecution. You need to understand the difference between positive and negative discrimination. Suppose you are Ambani-level rich man. Two persons come to you asking for Rs.100. One of them is a regular person. The other had Rs.100 stolen from him yesterday. If you give Rs.100 to the second person, but not the first, is that violation of equality ? If you refuse to give Rs. 100 to both persons citing equality, is that really equality ?"
20,You are assuming what was applied for Assam NRC will be applied across India. Thats way too much overthinking.
21,"basically this. CAA-NRC is as dangerous as it can get. Govt can't magically differentiate between illegal immigrants and ""honest"" Indians who don't have documents. And we know how un-documented India as a country is. Even ignoring all the religious arguments, we should oppose NRC just on the fact that it is futile and results in a huge burden on the economy and people. It's demonetization-2, looks good (for the so-called population register purpose) but results in a disaster"
22,"Well,the act isn't against the citizens of Non Muslim,so I don't really get your argument.  The prioritisation is on the basis of persecution. Sunni Muslims aren't persecuted in the same way as Non Muslims are in Pakistan. So to say that Non Muslims should be preferenced makes sense since they bear much of the brunt of the state and the society at large. Moreover,the state actually has evicted Pakistani Hindus enmasse and they've ended up being forcibly converted (500 of them,during the BJP rule). This act saves them from the ignominious disaster. Bringing in Freedom Fighters doesn't support your point. Gandhi advocated a Ram Rajya and was supportive of the Caste System. Bhagat Singh wanted a communist state. Bal Gangadhar Tilak would have wanted a Religious state and Ambedkar opined for a full population transfer."
23,"The documents as proof for NRC were applicable only for Assam. That is specifically because the Indian government signed the Assam Accord in 1985, and agreed to identify all people who were citizens as of 1971 (before the mass influx of Bangladeshi immigrants happened). In Assam even Aadhar and Passport has a different documentation requirement. For nationwide NRC, these documents may very well be acceptable. The law for nationwide NRC was passed by Manmohan Singh government in 2004 but the rules are not yet formulated. If local officials took bribe for NRC in Assam, that is a problem with the so called social and civic society created by decades of indifference, the very status quo that most of the protestors want to maintain. It doesn't mean the concept of NRC is wrong. Many countries have their versions of NRC including Malaysia which I know for sure and also probably Singapore, UK"
24,"Citizenship isn't being conferred in the basis of religion, but being fast-tracked on basis of religious persecution. All other misgivings on CAA have been answered in detail, here https://swarajyamag.com/amp/story/politics%2Fcitizenship-amendment-bill-and-its-myths-eliminating-some-confusions https://www.organiser.org/Encyc/2019/12/17/The-Citizenship-Act-and-the-need-for-it-explained.html https://myind.net/Home/viewArticle/facts-about-the-citizenship-amendment-act-which-those-spreading-misinformation-about-it-must-know"
25,"""In India , Citizenship is something that is conferred not on which religion you belong to or what caste you're from"" This is your belief, it's not written anywhere in the constitution. Positive discrimination or affirmative action is very much constitutional. We discriminate between castes and give reservation to lower castes on the basis of HISTORICAL discrimination they faced. Nonmuslims in our neighboring countries have even more justifiable right to preferential treatment since their discrimination continues at PRESENT. They are second class citizens according to the laws in those countries. And then we discriminate between religions and offer special benefits to certain religions in our country solely due to them being numerical minority. They have faced no persecution, historical or present."
26,"A lot of point I want to address. The people in Assam are going to be treated as illegal immigrants, in fact they already are. Nobody disputes that Hindus and people of other religion are refugees but they're not treated like one. The act specifically addresses that. We don't know what the NRC's procedure will be in future so arguing against a hypothetical scenario is idiotic. There are other valid points that should be raised currently. Just because we are a ""secular"" country doesn't mean that governance should be impotent. Freedom fighters fought to  free the people. Nobody gave them the authority to decide what India should have been. Did anyone consider the will of the people? How many referendums did we have to decide on the future of this country at the time? Or since then? So all of this raising the dead to defend some ideology or status quo is bullshit."
28,"Freedom fighter didn't write secular in constitution Indira in emergency did. Dr ambedkar did want exchange of population and didn't want secular to put in, coz India is secular inherently. Sardar patel speech regarding those who voted for 87% majority to form Pakistan didn't go to Pakistan. Did they become patriotic overnight? Gandhi, Dr Rajendra prasad and PM nehru promised this, so literally freedom fighters fought for this."
29,Man! NRC isn't even discussed. It could be a potential threat but isn't CAA the main focus. You cannot take a new law in its own silo. One law introduction can adversely impact the other. Law about who you allow to be made citizens has an impact on laws associated with registration of citizens.
31,"I'm not just against the idea of CAA but for the fact that India as a country is in no position to accept any refugees be it of any religion. Till the time all Indians do not have access to drinking water, home, electricity and food, till then India cannot take in refugees. The West takes them because they lack man power and need cheap labour, their population is older and soon they'll have majority of people in old age. Nobody and I mean nobody takes in refugees out of goodness of their heart. I however do think NPR/NRC is needed but it needs to be accurate and the margin of error has to be Nil."
32,"CAA wont create an influx of population. There's a cut off date, which was about 5 years ago. So only those people who have already been living here for more than that period and who belong to one of the 6 religions and 3 countries can get citizenship. So essentially, people migrating to India right now would have no effect from this act."
33,People are streaming in illegally anyway - in thousands if not millions. NRC is an attempt to stop that. Nobody and I mean nobody takes in refugees out of goodness of their heart. The whole global refugee policy and UNHCR actions are based on that principle.
35,"And it would be easy for any group of people to divide themselves as a sub group and claim to be persecuted. Hence for practical reasons, I believe there should be a boundary drawn (I understand, deciding where to draw the boundary could be highly subjective, so that also tells you that there isn't any wrong or right answer). Pakistan legally considers Ahmadiyas as non-Muslims, passports issued to Ahmadiyas say ""non-Muslim"". That's a very clear boundary. Ahmadiyas (who can provide such documentary proof) could have been easily included under the ambit of the CAA. Also, the Indian government has officially maintained in various international forums that Muslim minorities in Pakistan are being persecuted. For example, here's their statement at the United Nations Human Rights Council last year: https://www.pmindiaun.gov.in/pages.php?id=1953 Note their statement: ""Pakistan also orchestrates enforced disappearances, Sectarian violence and Systemic Persecution against Muslim minorities such as Shias, Ahmadiyas, Ismailias and Hazaras."" Since they have already ""drawn a boundary"" w.r.t which Muslim minorities they believe are being persecuted in Pakistan, why didn't they include them in the CAA?"
36,"It's to those who have been persecuted by the people from the 3 countries mentioned. Honestly there is no check on that, whether it was economic migration or religious one. One just need to belong to few particular religion. They will be given immunity against cases that can deter their application as well."
37,"Thanks for your response.  The government never calls for people to protest. Citizens decide if they want to protest or not. I agree, but by not addressing the masses through some kind of press conference, its not  helping the situation, only ignoring it or blaming it on the opposition.  Other than thatThey have started so many rallies, door to door campaigns to bust the myths associated. I stick to my earlier view because every time I see the PM or HM address it is in a BJP rally or on social media, both of which are  one-way. Haven't heard of any door-to-door campaigns in my city, so I reserve my judgement on their effects for now.  Coming on to another point - why aren't Rohingya Muslims being taken. I had this question as well, for which I was answered with many points, which made me convince why they were exempted but I still have my doubts regarding this. I too think this might be a valid issue. I don't know the details of their persecution, but I feel that if the purpose of this law was to give citizenship rights to a persecuted community so that they can avail benefits from govt schemes (as HM says), why not extend that benefit to ALL refugees? By fast tracking the process for only some people, aren't we suggesting that in some way the hardships faced by them was ""more"" than that faced by others like Rohingya Muslims or Tamil Hindus or any other persecuted refugee."
38,"The Act does not say 'persecuted minorities' only illegal migrants. Had it said the former maybe people wouldn't be so upset with it. But it does not. Moreover, it only 'benefits' those who have been here since 2015 (31st Dec 2014). So, people who are already here, not those seeking asylum or currently being persecuted abroad. If the government wanted to help them then the strategy should have been to create better living situation for refugees, but again this isn't about refugees, it's about all illegal migrants. Thirdly, (and this is a genuine question) we are all aware of how corrupt govt offices (irrespective of party) can be, how difficult it is to get a job, to access education and healthcare. So, what real benefits do these people now get? Other than voting rights? There's so much knitpicking in the propoganda on how the Act works, but ultimately it benefits ALL illegal migrants. It doesn't base citizenship off of merit or need, just your religion - and that makes this Islamophobic."
39,"Moreover, it only 'benefits' those who have been here since 2015 (31st Dec 2014). So, people who are already here, not those seeking asylum or currently being persecuted abroad. There should always be a cutoff! It's probably subjective on ethics, but it is PRACTICAL! You can never have an ill defined date or keep to a future date. This will create problems to a whole new level. So, what real benefits do these people now get? Other than voting rights? Maybe to you and me who belong to a well to do families wouldn't affect much. But there are crores of people who avail ration cards, subsidies from their identity. I think you'll get a better and in depth answer if you asked this to a women working for minimum income jobs. Other than voting rights? I personally think voting rights is something big."
41,"So, people who are already living in India since last 5 years will be granted citizenship. What's the harm in including Muslims in this list? Why not treat everyone the same? The intention might be good but given the govt. past history, it does feel little wrong."
42,"I know that, what I'm saying is even though they've been living here, India shouldn't grant them citizenship or the rights."
43,"I support CAA but oppose NRC. So I am kind of ok with current protest, as it serves as preemptive protest against NRC"
44,"But now that NRC is out of the way, don't you think that the same view that you're having is fueling the protest. (Which isn't wrong in anyway. You are free to protest.) But isn't your cause different from what the protest are actually for."
46,"I don't think anyone is against helping persecuted minorities. But if the country is trying to help persecuted people, why not also help others like Ahmediya Muslims in Pakistan? Do you have a problem with a version which helps everybody instead of some?"
48,"Yes, and many pakistani as well as bangladeshi immigrants have been given Citizenship in past. Your point being ?"
49,"It has been mentioned above but still I would repeat because this Act is a Jumla by Amit Shah. The act provides citizenship to refugees who are already in India (and hence safe), a vast majority of these refugees are already eligible for citizenship going by the regular 11 year process, even those who came on 31st Dec 2014, would be eligible by 2025. So this bill basically pertains to people who came between 2010-2014, why would the government just want to fast track citizenship for only these people. What is the government actually doing for the minorities right now who are not safe ? Nothing. That's why I call it a Jumla."
50,"And it's not a ""jumla"" by Amit Shah. CAA was first introduced by Congress & their leaders reiterated multiple times how important it is but never acted on it"
51,You don't get citizenship just because you were in the country for 11 years. It doesn't work that way.
52,your conspiracy theory may have had legs if CAA came out of thin air. But you have numerous proof of Congress asking for CAA starting from Gandhi to MMS/Kapil sibal etc Plus it is part of BJP manifesto which means not keeping those promises means they will likely lose their support so this fake argument won't fly here. u/crossang
54,There is nothing positive about discrimination. Period. Whether it is social towards the lower castes. Or whether it is towards gen quota in case of reservations. All discrimination does is promote hatred.
56,"NRC isn't out of the way. The announcement made categorically stated that ""No discussions are being held on NRC as of now"", but that doesn't mean, it's out of the way."
57,Current protests are against CAA and NRC both. Not against CAA alone.
59,"There may be more terms and condition's but you get what I am saying. Refugees in India are already safe, what is the government doing for minorities that are getting persecuted right now, if they care so much about them."
60,"i swear to god. im sick of this topic. caa is here. done. next. i could give a flying fuck for everyone to understand it. i dont understand why we have muslim laws and hindu laws in this country, but i aint hung up on it. just moving on. i cant understand why there is a fucking masjid over the birthplace of my god ... just moving on."
61,"This. I have no problem if all these trolling students miss their classes, fail their exams and stuff up their own lives."
62,"The open ended bottom clause highlighted in red. I read a great analogy here by someone: CAA is possibly a bulletproof vest that BJP is distributing to non-Muslims. NRC is possibly the gunfire. Pro-BJP folks are arguing that CAA protests are unwarranted  because there's no gunfire. This possiblity is apparently due to the BJP keeping this clause in CAA which allows for changes via rules ( no need for parliament approval). Source I'm not a legal expert in any way, but this seems very fishy and no one from BJP is clarifying this. Instead they're indications that this is rather intentional. It'd be great if someone could explain if this interpretation is wrong."
63,"u/TimeStopsInside You have to read that part in continuation of the first half. The imperative words here are ""entered"" into India + ""and"" exempted under. So the entered into India part is the 1st eligibility while ""and exempted under.."" is 2nd eligibility of not being treated as illegal immigrant. Both conditions must be fulfilled to not be treated as an illegal immigrant. The statement ""any rule or order made thereunder"" is a standard statement added in order to enable future ease of change but rules cannot be read independently, they have to be read in context of the clause they represent & here the clause is the first condition of the proviso about entering into India before 31.12.2014 which HAS to be fulfilled. How many current non Muslims citizens ""entered"" into India before 31.12.14? The act would only be a benefit to those u can prove they entered India & majority of our population did not. So non Muslims are not being given any bullet proof jacket through this Act. Plus, NRC will have a separate list of documents to prove citizenship. The interpretation provided in the article is just conjecture. That statement is very standard legal language & not fishy. The article itself mentions: one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh Even if we were to hypothesize that condition of ""religious persecution"" will be removed, the condition of migrant cannot coz it is present in the original law as the first condition. Edit: sorry meant to tag OP u/crossang"
64,your conspiracy theory may have had legs if CAA came out of thin air. But you have numerous proof of Congress asking for CAA starting from Gandhi to MMS/Kapil sibal ect. so this fake analogy won't fly here. u/crossang
65,I too cannot say if it was intentional or not. It does seem a little fishy.
67,"Are there any refugees from these faiths in India from Pak/BD/Afg? As per cutoff date of 31st Dec and IB records the official number of people are 31,313. Its not just 31,313. That's the whole point of the protests in NE isn't it. By NRC we have another 19 lakh of ""illegal immigrants"" being identified who don't have the required docs. Of these, 15 lakh are Hindus which can avail immediate citizenship through CAA, but the rest can't, even if they are genuine Indian citizens. They don't have to prove they were religiously persecuted, only claim that they were, and they would become citizens under CAA. It would be the same problem if and when a countrywide NRC is applied. No matter what documents are required or what the cut-off date is mentioned, there would still be those who don't have them. Then the people belonging to the 6 religions mentioned in CAA could potentially get citizenship through CAA, but the rest won't."
68,"Thanks for your response. I had some counter-points to some of your arguments: I get your point on the benefactors being given govt subsidies etc. I am not suggesting that the weren't persecuted, or that they don't deserve citizenship. I just feel that if this was the purpose of the act, it should be extended to every refugee facing persecution. For example, the Rohingyas living as refugees too could be included for them to get govt benefits. By introducing such a law, aren't we sort of comparing the hardships of one community against hardships of another? Coming to the NE, I know that certain parts of NE have already been exempted by ILP or 6th schedule, but the people of Assam are demanding that their ENTIRE state be exempted from the law. Their concern hasn't been addressed by the govt."
71,The CAA is fear mongering among different sects cast and religious groups. Today muslims are targeted then they say dalits will be targeted then females will be targeted. Until brahminical patriarchy is established. Also as muslims constitutes a larger part of population it may lead to another partition. It support caa and right now it is an important step and also a bold one
73,the response should be way too little research and then overthinking
74,That's why people are protesting. Because they believe these assumptions are reasonable. They (me included) no longer trust the government
75,"Their logic in a nutshell: Suppose if a country decides to give refuge to persecuted Yezidi community, than they will demand to give refuge to those religious extremists as well who persecuted the Yezidi people."
77,"It might be based on goodness of heart but nobody is accepting them on the basis of goodness of their heart. Tell me one country which did that, just one."
78,"Isn’t that overgeneralising thousands if not lakhs of people? That’s like saying that instead of a few nutjobs, the entire Kashmir population wants “Azaadi” or that just because someone lives in WB, they are communists."
79,What? Can you explain the first sentence. Overgeneralizing thousands for what?
81,"Same old diversion tactics. Can't refute, so of course you'll cry conspiracy. Laws must have safeguards to prevent misuse. This is a possible misuse scenario. It may be there intentionally or otherwise, but it's there. Hence it's worth of being opposed."
84,Nice to see that this group allows different points of view . Well done people . That India/r doesn't allow any other point of view they simply block you so much for free speech and fascist govt that they claim to oppose
87,"Sorry, using reddit on mobile messed things up. This was in response to u/dhatura who said the Rohingyas were These are fundamentalist Islamic terrorists for the most part, who killed the Hindu minority among them, why would we want these people? Even Bangladesh does not want them. in another comment. I think labeling an entire ethical community as ""fundamentally Islamic terrorists"" is wrong."
89,Thank you for explaining.
90,"In a hurry for now but I shall reply back with a few more related queries, thanks for the brilliant comment actually addressing the point I was trying to clarify! This is quite helpful."
91,"I agree the article is filled with conjectures hence why I highlighted this particular clause that caught my interest. You emphasized 'entered into India' as a mandatory eligibility factor.  A few questions for it: Who's liable to prove entry? The person or the government? What'll be an eligible proof of entry (assuming worst case scenario of a person with no documentation)? Would you say that 'entered into India' holds the same meaning in the extract I've quoted below from Citizenship Act 1955 ? It seems to me it's an explanatory term rather than an eligibility criteria. Extract: 2.(1)(b) “illegal migrant”means a foreigner who has entered into India―(i)  without  a  valid  passport  or  other  travel  documents  and  such  other  document  or authority as may be prescribed by or under any law in that behalf; Next, regarding the similar emphasis on 'migrant', assuming a personal has no documentation to prove his nationality, how can you possibly prove him/her to be a foreigner? Hence, I think foreigner is an explanatory term as well, not an eligibility criteria. Side-note: Do you happen to know if any prominent law scholars have discussed this point?"
92,Before CAA= 12 years normalization period for citizenship After CAA = Non-muslims from the neighbouring Islamic countries get 6 years in normalization duration and it stays 12 years for Muslims. Now add your political masala to it and swing lmfao.
94,"I voted BJP. I didn't agree with alot of their policies but felt Modi really wanted to move the country forward. I think context is important. Amit Shah, the RSS impunity, Ayodhya, CAA, Assam, Kashmir, Lack of accountability against police for targeting minorities all paint the same picture. Anti-Muslim rhetoric. I also feel Modi is two faced and has shown he'll blame the obvious scapegoats to disguise his shortcomings. We need to be competing with China as the base future is going to be difficult with 2 large populations next door to each other. Instead we're squabbling over the fantasies of every 12 year old Bakht"
95,"I haven't dug deep into it, but one of my doubts was always, how does one prove you are citizen of India. If the govt is going to define citizenship starting with the CAA/NRC, then i am not too confident on how this is going to go forward."
96,"There are several conditions that determine if you're citizen or not. Most of us wouldn't have to worry a bit, because we easily qualify. (If you've learnt how to calculate income tax through formal education, I think you would get what I'm saying. It's not exactly like that but you'll get an idea.) With CAA, there won't be any changes to citizenship or anything related to it for Indian citizens. With NRC, the government may introduce criteria, which based on the last FAQ (which no one knows if it was official) it shouldn't be a problem for any Indian citizens. And if the NRC is done for the entire country, then the criteria should (and mostly will) be a lot easier, than the NRC done in Assam."
98,"I'm against CAA for a simple reason- there are too many people in India as it is. We should be focussing on our own problems instead of acting out of sympathy to whoever is being persecuted somewhere. We need to stop being bleeding hearts. However, I'm pro NRC though (by the same logic). If you are not a citizen of India, then you need to go back."
99,"I think that's a respectable and valid opinion. However, I do not share the same thoughts."
100,"Why does the CAA does not mention the term ‘Persecution based on religion’? From the Assam NRC 1.9 million people were left out, where 1.3 million are Hindus, now the Hindus will be granted citizenship using CAA (since the act does not say to provide citizenship only if the applicants are persecuted based on religion) and the remaining 0.6 millions people which are Muslim will be declared illegal immigrant. This is what I understand. Am I missing something here? Can anyone reply to this and clear out the doubts?"
101,"Why does the CAA does not mention the term ‘Persecution based on religion’? From my understanding, mentioning ""persecution based on religion"" allows the law to be open ended and the makes it flexible to individuals interpretation. I personally think that laws should be as specific as possible, and leave as little room towards individual interpretation (exceptions are there to this though, but that's not the topic). Am I missing something here? 1.3 million which have entered before the cut off date will be given*. The rest will probably be deemed as illegal immigrants. Can anyone reply to this and clear out the doubts? What was your doubt again?"
104,"asked a frnd y she was against CAA.she shared faya d'souza fb video. kind of useless to the thread. sorry. if anyone able to find tht vid, pls share."
105,"TLDR - Summary of most objections to CAA Not against accepting minorities but against linking CAA with NRC. Fear that BJP will ride rough shod over all objections and implement NRC the way they want and probably dismiss minority sentiments. Finally, the sheer arrogance and brutality with which the govt has responded to objections and opposition has scared everyone that India is turning into a Fascist state. The problem in short is that BJP is implementing this law."
106,BJP has miserably failed in implementing multiple policies. I have my doubts.
107,This
108,Don't think anyone here is against only CAA. What most people are worried about Is the planned nation wide implemention of NRC+CAA which Shah said is their future plan
111,"""dekho beta, e sab humara dhyaan bhatkane ki kosis hai aur kuch nahi"" -Batantu chacha"
112,"CAA solely ig good and that should have been done long ago but when you combine with NRC it becomes difficult,tbh it looks straight from BJP hand book to polarize. Amit shah had himself said there is no need to provide documents for them then the indian citizen who is hindu can escape that water but what about muslims. I also think they are doing this for their vote bank in Assam. When you reply please dont say NRC hasn't been discussed anywhere,that would deplore this conversation."
116,"CAA does not make anyone ""non-citizens"". I feel that you have misconceptions about this."
119,"BJP can't implement shit on this scale , its a disaster like demo"
120,"No, the logic is if they are being persecuted they deserve refuge. The notion that a Muslim cannot be persecuted in a Islamic nation is absurd.  Malala Yousafzai had to flee her country. Several Germans were against the Nazi regime, who also needed refuge.  Statements like this are simply ignorant."
121,Was she targeted because she was speaking against Islam or against the terrorists residing in Pakistan? How many times she has spoken against the persecution of minorities and condemn the religious bigots in her own country? How ignorant you are to not to see the difference between the two. Also how many Sunni Islamic people you have come across who spoken out against persecution in the countries where they themselves are in majority?
124,"However, I do not share the same thoughts. and that's totally fine!"
126,An afghani Christian and a rohingya Muslim both have been persecuted and both are suffering but you only take the Christian guy in and kick the Muslim guy out. Is that humanity?
0,"The answers that are pro CAA are being brigaded from a pro Hindutva sub, r/IndiaSpeaks. https://np.reddit.com/r/indiaspeaks/comments/eefhux/_/ OP: there are opposing views on this bill, but it boils down to the fact that one group considers India as a Hindu state, the other considers India as a pluralistic, secular democracy. This bill is dangerously close to setting a precedent of making Indian citizenship based on religion, and a lot of people are uncomfortable with this. Yes, nothing is set in stone right now, so the NRC could be wholly inclusive, but the ruling political party has been voted to power on their pro Hindu, borderline anti Muslim rhetoric. Personal opinion, but it is also a way to distract from the real issues like rising food prices, unemployment and a sluggish economy."
1,Good job dude
2,"Muslims from these 3 countries weren't included in this act as they don't face any problems in these ""Islamic states"". This is not true, as there are subsections within Muslims, and conflicts do arise between them. Even if that was the case, that is Muslims actually do not face any problems, then the Muslims does not have to be excluded explicitly by the law. I mean, what is the logic in explicitly forbidding something that is not going to happen any way? So that is discrimination based on religion, and thus should not be allowed to be part of the constitution."
3,Commies and liberandus downvoted you for speaking up 100% facts.
4,Yes! This is exactly it
5,Wow don't know why the heck are you being downvoted looks like some idiots r/india and r/pakistan cannot gulp down the facts.
6,bakchodi user
7,If they would have understood this simply there would be no mess like it is now. And i am surprised there is no other explanation coming out of any commie till now.
8,"Answer: Attempting to explain why people are protesting, i.e. how they see the events/bill: CAA or the Citizenship Amendment Act is the first bill (now passed into law) where citizenship to India is linked to the religion of the person applying for citizenship. Protestors see this as an affront to the secular nature of India (Preamble to the Constitution of India reads: ""We, the People of India, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic."") CAA is being linked to the NRC or the National Register of Citizens. While the NRC has not been tabled or passed yet, the Home Minister clearly said in Parliament that it is going to be done. The Prime Minister is now back-tracking claiming there is no discussion of NRC despite the Home Ministers clear assertions in Parliament. A state version of the NRC was done in the border state of Assam as there are many undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh in Assam. The result left 1.9 million people off the Citizenship Register, the registration required burdensome documentation including proof of residence of yourself or your ancestors before 1971, and it cost a lot of money. While no documentation details of a nationwide NRC have been officially released, people fear they may not have or be able to provide documents if the requirements are stringent. India has hundreds of millions of poor and illiterate people, they will likely be the ones most affected if lots of documents are required. To summarise the fear of the people in the linking of the CAA (a bill passed into law) and the NCR (not officially passed or tabled yet):  The NRC will likely delist millions of predominantly poor people who will lose their citizenship and voting rights. This will include Hindus, Muslims and other religions. 2)After the delisting, the CAA will allow the Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist who have been left off the NRC to apply as refugees living in India and be fast-tracked to Indian Citizenship. While not allowing this same process for the Muslims left off of the NRC. The end result being a disenfranchising of predominantly Muslims. Note: The reason the state of Assam is protesting the CAA is different to the reasons of most of India. Assam has a high undocumented immigrant population from Bangladesh. They fear the CAA offering citizenship to many of these immigrants will make the ethnically Assamese a minority in their own state and lead to the erosion of their distinct language and culture. To re-iterate: I am explaining the reasons many are protesting, not claiming the legitimacy of their fears or whether they are true, right, or wrong."
9,On what legal grounds do they stand for excluding muslims on the application?
10,"Why is citizenship important? I mean, in India specifically, why would you fear not being a citizen? Only because of voting?"
11,"because religious persecution (inter-religious) and sectarian persecution (intra-religious) are different.. By definition, sectarian persecution is a subset of religious persecution, so anything that fall under sectarian persecution should fall under religious persecution, which renders that argument/answer invalid."
12,"Answer: In a nutshell: India is a secular nation. Constitution clearly says so. The current BJP government has passed a bill to provide citizenship for immigrants on the basis of religion, excluding just the Muslims. And the government is known for their notorious religious extremism (hindutva) and ill-founded nationalism. I can site lot of hate crimes against minorities (especially Muslims), lot of government policies drafted just to favour Hindutva and actual quotes from their leaders wanting the country to be a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Country). Hence, people are riled up because they see this as BJP's initial steps in wiping out all other religions in the country, basically throwing out the all secular and plural values, which makes India, well, India."
13,"On the basis of being members of a religion that is persecuted in their home countries. That's why the law specifies countries of origin and religion. It's a known con-flux of persecution. So, if a nation passed a law granting easy citizenship requirements to Jews in the 1940's, would that violate any secular principals that nation may claim?"
14,"The persecution of muslims in Myanmar and China was in fact much more sanctioned by the govt than those of minorities in Pakistan. BJP is famous for using the letter of the law to break the spirit of the law. A recent example was Article 370. By our constitution it could only have been revoked with the cooperation of the J&K govt, but BJP took the opportunity when J&K didn't have a functioning govt to scrap it almost unilaterally. I see each of your justifications and see the same pedantic excuses. 3. CAA is not like SC/ST reservations. It's like if we gave reservations to all but one ST tribe even though they face the same persecution from upper caste Hindus that others do."
15,"And also, just to add to the top comment, the main reason the CAA is being criticised is because of the ambiguity in its enforcement, which can mean that the powers that be can now legally evict minorities out of the nation. These protests have lately taken a turn for the worse, and are getting increasingly violent. The scale and nature of these protests is leading it to become somewhat similar to the situation in Hong Kong, and at this point, it seems like the government is suppressing dissent. For example, in Mangalore, located in South Karnataka, two people were killed by police firing, and in Bangalore, the silicon valley of India, permission has been granted to hold Pro-CAA protests today, 23/12/19, but the same has been denied to anti-CAA protests. This is being perceived by many as the government being biased, as the ruling party at the centre is also in power in the state of karnataka. While we cannot completely say that the ruling party is indeed suppressing dissent, it's is quite plausible, keeping in mind the events that have transpired in many metropolitan areas of India."
16,"Not relevant to what OP asked but had to be said, India isn’t truely secular. Secular means Uniform Civil Code which India doesn’t have. Hopefully the current ‘hindutva’ govt will pass it. That would really be secular now wouldn’t it?"
17,"That's a start but India really needs a change in attitude. Hindus, Muslims... everyone. Hating on your fellow man because they are a different religion can't lead to a truly secular society."
18,"India is truly secular, it's right there in the constitution. I'm fine with implementing the Uniform Civil Code which will take us one step further in making our secular values concrete. Can you oppose CAA on the same basis? Just accept it and move on - you and your brethren do not want India to be secular. Saves both of our time."
19,"Thanks for taking tome to write this. I am all for CAB, however, there are many more questions that are raised, which is why people think it is anti-Muslim. 1: Why are only Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan including? You don’t need to be an “Islamic Republic” to persecute minorities 2. Why is religious persecution the main element of this? Countries are also persecuting minorities based on non religious ethnic identities. See China and Myanmar now, and earlier Sri Lanka with the Tamils. You could argue that all 3 of these countries are/ were fighting separatist movements and hence it is a temporary political issue, and not a long term permanent persecution. But I have not seen this argument made yet. 3. Why exclude Ahmadis in Pakistan? Yes, India might see them as Muslims, but within Pakistan, they are not seen as Muslims, and persecuted as non Muslims. Maybe even worse than other religious minorities! It would have been better to just come out straight and recognize that India is the birth place of Dharmic religions and that we have a duty of care to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists around the world. And thus India will offer our help to them whenever possible. It doesn’t mean Indian Muslims are second class citizens, but it is a recognition of our cultural history."
20,Might get downvoted. But as an Ahmadi I appreciate you calling out point 3. I'm indian but most of my friends are Pakistani and I have some pakistani family. So many of them have been touched by the horrid persecution that's more or less endorsed by the government.
21,"To answer your first question, I think it is because of the countries that border India, those three are defined as Islamic in their constitutions, while others (Nepal, Bhutan) have secular constitutions. I personally think myanmar should be included, as they say they are Buddhist in their constitution."
22,Answer: Adding one more point to u/waeva's comment: A Muslim Pakistan was carved out of India as a home for Muslims of the country. Millions of non-Muslim refugees made their way to India and were given Indian citizenship. However persecution of non-Muslims continues till today in Pakistan so India should be seen as a natural home for the non-Muslims of Pakistan. This act could be seen as an extension of that partition.
23,"Muslim Pakistan was carved out of India as a home for Muslims of the country. No, it was carved out for those who wanted to live in a Islamic republic. There were millions of Muslims who voluntarily stayed back in India. Saying India is a home for only Non-muslims goes against the secular values of our country."
24,why is this comment being downvoted .?
25,"You're forgetting about NRC. That's one of the biggest reasons people are pissed about this, because in combination with the CAB it's basically  a way for the government to ruin the lives of a huge amount of Muslims (a group the government has expressed hatred for, with multiple members of the party being part of major anti-Muslim groups and being involved in anti-Muslim riots) while giving people from basically every other major religion in India a get-out-of-jail-free card. Edit: Here's a comment that explains the rest of the context which the original commenter has ingeniously ignored: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/eee5en/whats_up_with_india_against_caa/fbttmc7?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
26,"I have a doubt. I have seen some videos which claim that CAA will not help the non muslims who couldn't prove their citizenship as they will have to prove that they came from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh and that they suffered through religious persecution. If the people can't even give simple documents, how can they proof something thats not even true? NRC is gonna fuck the poor and illiterate irrespective of the religion as they won't be able to access CAA. Thus, discrimination on the basis of CAA+NRC sounds pretty non existent to me. The YouTube channel called ""The open letter"" made the video i m talking about. Please clear my confusion."
27,"You are right about the problem of getting documents, but please watch the below video and try to understand what the actual implementation will be like. If you are from India or have any experience with how the country works, you will know that what is written law and what actually happens is quite different. Hopefully this cleared your confusion on why people are protesting. https://twitter.com/i/status/1207263602148724736"
28,"I'm sorry but this is blatantly false. I don't know if you're genuinely misinformed or here to spread BJP propaganda, but the CAA doesn't just 'reduce the waiting time for citizenship from the usual 11 years to 5 years for Hindu/Buddhist/Sikh/Parsi/Christian refugees'. Your period of residence in the country would only be considered if you entered the country legally, and you are then granted citizenship on grounds of naturalization, for which, like you said, the waiting time has been reduced from 11 years to 5 years for Hindus etc. Before the amendment, you simply could not become an Indian citizen if you were an illegal immigrant, but the most crucial aspect of the amendment, which this post completely misses, is that if you are an illegal Hindu/Christian/Sikh immigrant, you would automatically be granted the status of a legal immigrant, and you can then gain citizenship based on the reduced naturalization period."
29,"I don’t think any country would be okay with granting citizenship to illegal immigrants. Refugees? Sure, makes sense. Illegal immigrants? Nope"
30,wow..that clarified so many things I didn't see such a justification in r/India. Why are some ppl still protesting?
31,"Their PM said that western ideas of human rights do not apply to India, so there is probably some disconnect it what they say is happening and what is actually happening."
32,"There is one crucial part of this post which is factually incorrect. Before CAA, there was no pathway for any illegal immigrant to get Indian citizenship (regardless of religion). So, if a Muslim is not on the NRC list then they will be declared an illegal immigrant and have no safety net to remain in India. Their ""wait time"" is not increased, they are declared illegal immigrants and will be sent to detention centers. In fact even those belonging to any other religion will have to prove that they came from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, or Pakistan. Another thing to consider is how much of a mess the NRC has been in Assam. Doing it nationwide will be a nightmare. There is also the cost of doing this, 1200 crore just for Assam means massive spending for this exercise."
34,"This is a very biased answer, it doesn't even touch on the NRC and how, Muslims living in India before the seperation of Pak-Bang 1971 need to prove they lived their, if they can't prove it whether or not they have been living there, their citizenship is revoked. Take a look at the post history. Now people in the very"
35,"Wait, I may just be a naive American, but I thought Bangladesh was majority Hindu. Isn't that why they broke away from Pakistan? They were originally ""East Pakistan"", which was an exclave of Pakistan, after the original partition of India upon independence from Britain after all."
37,None whatsoever.  That's the issue.
39,State propaganda alert!!! There is no mention of NRC in this and that the protests are more about CAA+NRC than CAA alone. u/sidvicc is on point with his explanation.
41,"What about the eelam Tamizhs, then? Why aren't they included? you can spin this in whatever way you want, and we can do this technicality BS all day long, but we both know what is the actual agenda of the government."
42,"They fear the CAA offering citizenship to many of these immigrants will make the ethnically Assamese a minority in their own state and lead to the erosion of their distinct language and culture. Woah, arrest these neo-nazi Assamese supremacists for spreading racist conspiracy theories."
43,"Don't agree with the second delisting point in NRC, mate. For delisted Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, etc to regain citizenship under CAA, they would need to show some sort of domicile papers from either Pakistan or Bangladesh or Afghanistan. So this notion that non-Muslims will get a free pass in NRC (which hasn't even been formulated yet mind you) is just wrong. Lastly, a comment on the topic in general. A lot of chaos has been generated by huge misinformation spread by media and left leaning activists. People on ground, especially Muslims, have been led to believe that only they will thrown out, when that is absolutely false and dangerous."
45,"Wow, that's thorough!"
46,"You have one big mistake and smells of big BIAS, you said > 2)After the delisting, the CAA will allow the Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist who have been left off the NRC to apply as refugees living in India and be fast-tracked to Indian Citizenship. While not allowing this same process for the Muslims left off of the NRC. The end result being a disenfranchising of predominantly Muslims. I am astounded at the mass of educated hindu knuckleheads who argue against their own welfare with passion based on half baked logic. For ex: Hindu : just yesterday, all non-muslims like me with no documents have safety blanket under NRC due to CAA, so CAA+NRC is discriminatory for all Indians. Me( non-hindu) : how? do you have proof that you come from one of the 3 countries listed in CAA. Without that, you will also be detained if you have no documents, so CAA+NRC is not discriminatory against Indians. Hindu : ...crickets..... and then...  um, what do you think about Assam agitation ... and the cycle continues basically the whole charade about CAA+NRC is exactly that.. a big fear mongering charade So you are willing to think that there are non-muslims in India who won't have one of 14 documents asked in Assam NRC or one of 7+ documents of their ancestors but will magically have documents to prove they are from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh. explain how?"
47,"Consider a Hindi/Urdu/Bengali speaking Indian(ground truth). If he cannot produce documents and is declared non-NRC complaint or essentially non Indian. Then where can he belong to apart from those 3 countries and Nepal. In all the above cases if the person is Hindu, he has safety blanket to get back to being Indian citizen while Muslims have none. So law is discriminatory to Indians (ground truth) who are declared as non Indians (NRC) for lack of documents. Add to this the compromised executive that can reinterpret same laws at will , you are very close to Nuremberg for Muslim Indians"
48,"Friendly reminder that all top level comments must: be unbiased, attempt to answer the question, and start with ""answer:"" (or ""question:"" if you have an on-topic follow up question to ask) Please review Rule 4 and this post before making a top level comment: http://redd.it/b1hct4/ I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

0,appreciate the effort for compiling and putting the facts in place. Let's hope the Delhi violence is the last of the protests we witnessed so far!
1,"If possible, they should copy this to some document. Better than linking to this sub because people will just say that it's the Indian version of t_d and ignore it."
2,I'm convinced that almost half the entire population at this point are just tools with no free will. No one even thinks about looking at the facts before jumping to conclusions. Just actually take time to understand the laws like goddamn.
3,"Oh no, this comment didnt last long"
4,And If you Found some more videos and Evidences of Persecution and Other Bad Things Going on in the protests Please feel free to share.. i will add them .. it will be beneficial if we collect as much proofs..sources as we can

15,"This is Amazing! For a person like me who is not in the country currently this post gives a clear understanding of what's this all about! Keep updating this thread will save this and keep checking everyday for updates. Too much information out there these days,most of it being biased, most like me are unable to form an own opinion based on biased news reporting and people ranting on Social media. Thanks again man!"
16,"such a sad thing that although we are on the right, it's we who become the villains. Call it failure to put the facts out or failure to properly utilise the  social media as a tool to counter the propaganda and misinformation. It's now or never!"
17,We have to spread this asap because left wing already succeeded in spreading their propaganda! no smoke without fire buddy there campaign works because most of the protesters already had a deep rooted hatred for Modi and they were just looking for a reason to do something like this . Bullas and libturds and then followed by low iq centrists .
18,The left is calling CAA anti-constitutional is a stupid argument. India recognises the minority rights and they can be given special aid according to their caste and religion. The people who will get the citizenship are in fact minorities of the counties mentioned. WTF is the fuss about?
19,"Just read the Wikipedia page on this topic, a lot of questionable information is there."
20,Are you sure there have been no muslims deaths in the delhi riots? Because the names of the dead people coming out do not seem to suggest that.
21,"Yes, I'm pretty sure I saw some muslims in the list. OP edit your description, only post facts."
22,Removed that line.. Sorry For that Inaccuracy m trying to Update this post as much as i can with sources and proofs..
25,Now add this
27,"According to the names list, there were muslim deaths too. Also, you need to add the Lautenberg Amendment of the United States."
28,"Yep,there were Muslim Names So i Removed that Line.. will add Lautenberg soon"
29,"There is also the state benefits argument for CAA. As the Sachar Committee report states, Muslims are the poorest and underdeveloped community in India. They live in ghettos and their population growth rate is increasing. It is a social time bomb and has to be addressed. They also harbor illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Rohingya's from Myanmar. If these illegals get benefits, then it just incentivizes more illegal migration. Also, climate change will displace many millions from Bangladesh. If we do not act on it now, it will be too late."
30,Mods please pin this. Thank you taking such effort in fighting misinformation.
31,"good collection, but a wall of text will turn-off the casual reader, it has to organized into sections, with as few outgoing links as possible. see my post for example. Also mention that CAA is similar to USA's Lautenberg amendment"
32,PLEASE ADD THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT NRC : Will there be an implementation of nation-wide NRC in future as promised by our honorable Home Minister Amit Shah (Chronology) after protests from these radical islamic terrorists? If Aadhar and Voter ID is a proof of citizenship then why do we need NRC ?
33,Aadhar isn't proof of citizenship. It says so on the card itself. Idk about voter id though.
34,"This is what has always bugged me. What is the point of AAdhar and Voter ID? Also - the issue could have been minisculed if the BJP had also spoken about the country's development. It gives a view that they are only interested in casteism and, divide and rule."
35,I have added.. that.. The Home Minstry On 4th Feb Said They dont have any plans as of now to implement it..
36,"Request to pin this, mods 🙏"
37,"Also one more thing. People somehow compare NRC with Assam's NRC. Assam's NRC has nothing to do with BJP. NRC is implemented in Assam by the orders of Supreme Court. Modi/BJP has nothing to do with it. If you have a problem with Assam's NRC, Blame the Supreme Court not Modi."
38,If You will Provide Me proper Source i will Add it
40,"Agree with your post except a little bit this part: So Why the hell Are these Dumbasses protesting against something.. that DOESNT EXIST...HASNT BEEN DRAFTED.. PASSED It makes a little sense because the current govt is a simple majority. The chance of that happening again is (with left or any other) is really rare. Simple majority govt has an advantage in enacting laws. So once drafted and tabled, only the SCourt can actually do smth about it, others can be steamrolled via democratic proccess argument. (We got the mandate, so f ur opinion). This was seen with TT and other legistations. Once enacted, it would near impossible to rollback. (But some stops can be put at various lelvels like they did with motor vehicles act) That being said - these protests are an absolute overkill and does not help their cause at all. It is an uncontrolled, politically motivated chaos to make the govt lose face. Bold strategy, lets see if it works."
42,"Appreciate the effort, Posts like these should be circulated on Whatsapp."
43,"Why Aadhaar lol? Aadhaar is a fuсking joke.  Just make it Birth Certificates, School Certificates, Passports, marriage certificates, Voter ID or court testaments.  PAN and Aadhaar don’t prove citizenship and can be acquired by anyone."
44,Idk man Aadhar has helped me a lot in making my bank account or filling forms or for my uncle who sells his crops to the government.
45,Good post
46,"OP, you mention that you are intending to add facts to the post. Please add the fact that Ahmedis and Baha'is are also religious minorities in the countries. Also add persecution related to them in the post. You can find all of it in Wikipedia. Like... If You ever open an app for first time it shows you to sign up..using many different Options like Googleplay/Facebook/Gmail.. etc..you get the idea right? CAA Just Adds additional Method of Sign up.. Like Lets for an example If an adds and additional Sign up Method Through twitter.. the other communities in this case (phone number, email,fb logging ones) cant call this discrimination..it will sound stupid.. but thats what is happening in India.. I have never seen an example worse than this. To mend your example, it would be as if people from twitter will be allowed to sign up but people from facebook will have to wait for 10 years, compounded by the fact that you can only make an account on one of them and changing which platform you make your account on redefined your one of the most basic beliefs. In One Word NPR Is ""CENSUS"" Of India Don't oversimplify it. Census happens every 10 years already, NPR is additional. How Can You Prove Your Identity The whole section is wrong. It has been reiterated again and again and again that these are not valid documents. So Why the hell Are these People protesting against something.. that DOESNT EXIST...HASNT BEEN DRAFTED.. PASSED..? Because it has been said that it will be and without any information on in which way. Assuming that it is in the way of Assam, the protests make sense. If you say here that people should not protest based on assumption, the government had enough time to clear those assumptions, and if they had any wish to sort the problems, they would have done that two months back. Answer: Radical Islamic Terrorism More than 38 People are killed till now in the clashes till now. Majority of them Muslims. Also, not sticking to facts here. To Gain More International Appeal As Trump Was Visiting While These Protest Was Going On You are not sticking to facts. This is speculation by one side of the people. How many Citizenships Of any Citizen Stripped Till Now? NONE. Include the Assam NRC How Much Violence Have They Caused Till Now? By they, I assume you mean rioteers? Then include the links of temples and all too. If you want to remain relevant and accurate, please don't paint a biased picture. Please try to stick to facts. Edit: formatting"
47,"Ahmedis and Baha'is are also religious minorities They maybe. But they are sects within a religion. They are sectarian minorities, not religious minorities. Also, it's not just religious persecution that matters. It is State sanctioned religious persecution, meaning Constitution approves of denigrating non Muslims."
48,Ahem.. I have stated All My Arguements And everything  With  Support of Links and everything if you argue about The details..I would Suggest You Post Links So That I can Verify Your Claims..
49,Ahmadis were the biggest supporters of partition. Boo hoo if their peaceful brothers are the ones slaughtering them. Not our problem
50,The population of Brahmans whose Kul-Devta is Shiv is lower than that of Muslims so Those Brahmans should get minority status?? I'm not sure but I don't think it's written on their documents if they're Ahmedia so that could be troublesome
51,It’s really difficult to find the views in favour of CAA due to the fact that overwhelming amount of opinions are anti-CAA. This compilation is really well made. My utmost respect to you for this effort to clear some things up.
52,Sort by controversial
54,"No. They are religious minorities, not subgroups of Islam according to the constitution of the countries being talked about. I feel that since it is state sanctioned religious persecution, which as you said constitution approves of denigrating non-muslims, the religious minorities should be decided as per the same state. In that case, Ahmedis will be in the 'highly persecuted religious minority list'. Edit: I replied to his comment correcting the incorrect point that they are not sectarian minorities but religious minorities. Also, that the religious persecution against them is state sanctioned religious persecution. Why am I being downvoted? Is presenting facts now wrong in this sub?"
56,"Not all your arguments. I mentioned them in the above one. For example the section on what all is valid is completely inaccurate. Also, I'm not saying you haven't (most). I am saying the things you have posted show one side of the post. Since your post has such visibility, it will be beneficial for all if you post all the information, irrespective of your beliefs regarding the matter. The post title does say 'Everything about CAA, NRC, NPR, Protests and Riots'. You seem like you are willing to edit it if presented with facts, as another poster said with the muslim deaths in riots thing, so I suggested the same."
57,"Man, this post is of so much misinformation and biased that this dude thinks we need to prove our identities for NRC. So Why the hell Are these People protesting against something.. that DOESNT EXIST...HASNT BEEN DRAFTED.. PASSED..? Ahh, the same shit. Man, I wonder how low these people can comprehend. CAB was passed and the govt is repeteadly saying ""you can't do shit, the bill is passed"" and these idiots want NRC to be passed for people to protest. We have an NRC as an example (Assam). We know what to expect and that is why people are protesting. How hard it is to comprehend? At this point, this sub is just circle-jerking over ""Hindus good, Muslims Bad"". It's just funny how these people want to become the ""main"" subreddit for India over the other (agree that it's shitty though) when you are filled with hatred and just can't see beyond your biases"
58,"Ahh, the same shit. Man, I wonder how low these people can comprehend. CAB was passed and the govt is repeteadly saying ""you can't do shit, the bill is passed"" and these idiots want NRC to be passed for people to protest. He was talking about NRC not CAA. Have you ever considered that maybe a little bit of reading comprehension is necessary in life? We have an NRC as an example (Assam). We know what to expect and that is why people are protesting. How hard it is to comprehend? The government has explicitly said that nationwide NRC will not be like Assam's NRC. So that argument falls flat too."
59,So much effort to raise awareness. Take my upvote and my respect
60,Thank You!
61,"Couple of questions with context- India has always been a secular nation (atleast constitutionally) and if Muslims are not persecuted in the neighbouring countries - why not include them too? Give them also an option to move here legally. Reasons could be many - India is more liberal with Muslim and hindu laws as compared to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Washington post and other news outlets - yes they have posted a few times terrorist sympathetic articles - but that does not give a certainty that they are pro terrorism. If you look at their history, they have constantly published articles and discussion in stopping terrorism and specifically ISIS. Ps. These are just questions and not hate questions. Just a normal discussion with no intention of only being proven right but - to get a better understanding. To add - I feel the riots could have been planned by the BJP as a shit show for losing elections. Because if they wanted to - they could have contained it within hours as they hold the police and yes, to a certain extent, the army"
62,Riots planned by BJP on the day BJP PM is hosting Trmp & his credibility is on the line. How blind do you have to be to support that narrative?
63,"Muslims from neighbouring countries or from anywhere else can move to India through the normal process. Some have used it. Adnan Sami is a Pakistan born singer and musician who was given citizenship during current Govt of India. Are you defending their current stance on terrorism? Your feeling is just an speculation based on your feeling towards the ruling party of India. While one may accuse the Govt and security agencies of not doing their job perfectly, there is no evidence to support your speculation. Instead, the proofs emerging right now tell of a Islamist hand in it. Still, let's wait for the investigation report before claiming anything."
64,"India has always been a secular nation (atleast constitutionally) Where do these people with negative IQ even come from? Before you lay these turds of opinions elsewhere go do some reading about the 42nd amendment. why not include them too? Why should we? They demanded separate state and took a portion of land for it, why should we be bringing them back here? Let them rot in their shitholes. Give them also an option to move here legally They already have it, no one is denied entry through legal pathways. yes they have posted a few times terrorist sympathetic articles - but that does not give a certainty that they are pro terrorism. Yes that person has raped some girls a few times, doesn't mean he's a rapist. That's exactly how this incoherent statement sounds like. shit show for losing elections. They lost jharkhand recently, no riots observed there, lost Maharashtra despite highest margin, not a single riot reported, same with Karnataka last year, no riots, but when entertaining one of most powerful president against whom they want to maintain a positive image, they somehow start a riot? Where do these enlightened centrist turds come from? Are the mods sleeping or what?"
66,"The main critisism of NPR is not the fact that it's a census. It's the extra questions it includes, which go beyond what is normally asked. Here's an article : https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/answers-to-some-frequently-asked-questions-on-npr-and-nric In a short form, it requests information on the date/ place of birth of your parents, and based on a few studies, there are quite a few people (not only Muslims) who do not have that exact data. This allows them to be placed in the ""doubtful"" category. Now if we are wrong to suggest that these category of people would be the first in line to get placed in the NRC ""Doubtful"" list and probably get their citizenship removed, then let the government put the case to rest then. So far it hasn't. To quote the article: ""There is no categorical official denial by the government yet that such entries in NPR will never be placed in the doubtful category of NRC. Therefore, it is being opposed now."" Please engage in civil discussion."
67,Am I to presume you are against any immigrant being evicted from India?
68,Imagine citing that trash rag of congress as a news source.
71,These protestors say that article 14 doesnt allow this .If article 14 is the basis for removing CAA then first remove reservation .
73,"You said there are no other country for hindu...but there are many for Christian why include them. No sri lankan tamils. They have to wait as usaual why ? It's not a extra way it's fucked up law....parsi from other part will have to wait 11 year and from these 3 country only 5. Its like US givinging nepali hindu PR in 5 year and Indian hindu in 11 year. Jabki iran walo ko jarurat thi. Bc yeh 3 country ka concept hi isliye laye hai muslims ko alag kar sake majority bolke. Persecution toh bhut jagh ho raha itni humdardi hai toh. Can't trust govt. After various comments from various minister, remove extra clauses from NPR then fine otherwise there are various way and reason to not provide info. NRC mai jo hindu aaye ge unka kya...??  I know many jinpe bas voter card ya vo bhi nai hai. Assam mai hindu aaye unka kya kiya jaye ga."
74,Citizenship by naturalization had been decreased to 5 years completely if I remember correctly....I don't think it's been reduced for only those three countries
75,"dear friend do you know that while partition was happening dalits were forced to stay there as then current pm says ""if they will go who will clean our shit"" so 80% of the population from bangladesh and pakistan are dalits."
78,Biased
79,How?
80,It Would be biased if i gave my opinion M Giving statements backed with links and Sources
81,"Extremely, yes, but then again this entire subreddit is biased."
82,Spread this!!
83,"If left out of NRC, CAA ensures that all hindus entering India before 31 dec.2014 automatically becomes citizens. By the same logic, muslims entering India before 31 Dec 2009 also become citizens. Nullifying statement 2 automatically nullifies statement 1. Fight propaganda with propaganda"
84,"You say that census happens every 10 years and it has been done 15 times, so does that mean it was started before freedom? Because that makes the period of census recording 150yrs. Please edit if wrong or atleast state that it started before freedom because when I share this, I need this to be totally correct."
85,Census of  India is Been Done From 1872
86,Some Muslims in Pakistan ARE persecuted!
87,"They don't want to come to India, upto to them. Should go to Islamic countries"
88,"As Said In Reports.. NO MUSLIM has ever seeked refugee in india... Based on ""religious persecution"" I think they prefer a countries especially made for muslims.. like saudi and other ME countries"
89,"They can go to Iran then, it's pure Islamic theocracy, much better than kafir infested India."
90,and?so?
91,A correction...  Aadhaar is not a valid proof of citizenship as clarified by UIDAI
92,thanks! A site mentioned Aadhar So i had made it in the list.. Will Remove it By further verifying
93,Removed
96,You really haven't done your homework.
97,Thanks for creating such a detailed post.
102,Yeah punish kids for their grandparents faults nbd...
103,"You see, no one here has answers to your questions. Cuz almost everyone here is a brainwashed sheep. They will only walk with the herd even though the herd is heading down a steep cliff."
104,"but there are many for Christian why include them. you know the closest christian state? greece sri lankan tamils. They have to wait as usaual why ? because sri lanka has made an effort to rehabilitate the community. India too has given aid to the community there. Again, Sri Lankan tamils are not being killed because they are hindus parsi from other part will have to wait 11 year and from these 3 country only 5 Yeah I wonder who is persecuting and torturing the parsis in Iran? I wonder why parsis had to come to india from iran a thousand years ago? It probably has nothing to do with Islamic extremism Persecution toh bhut jagh ho raha itni humdardi hai toh. because the 2 countries mentioned were a part of the Raj. They divided themselves on the basis of religion. Just fyi, tibetan buddhists are the majority of the refugees in india. also your english gave me brain damage, please stop typing like a 12yo."
105,This a link to a video report of the whole event Delhi riots 
106,Awesome post and greatly summarised!! The people currently protesting against nrc and caa are just using this as a political tool!! Good job!
108,Tag right wing twitter handles to spread this.
109,Its not r/worldnews
112,"Right wing loses becauses they don't lie. Left manufactures a lie and then rw loses energy trying to counter and educate them by writing columns that ""how x is a lie"".  No need to do that. Left is sadistic by nature. Just ignore it and meme it. Left hates being ignored. Countering gives them engagement and money by their handlers. They don't wait long and soon another lie will be dropped. Ignore it, meme it. Propaganda neede to be countered. But instead of waiting for them to launch and then counter it, start your own. Let them counter it."
116,Edited by leftists
117,"Heard some American low life comedian just casually say that modi passed a law to ""round up Muslims"" . Without any sense of irony that it's completely fake news."
118,"You need to note the terms ""Comedian"" and ""American lowlife"". His opinions don't matter."
119,"Very well written dude. I have a question though, aren’t there muslim minorities that are discriminated in Islamic countries too? And are these the only countries from where citizens seek refuge in India; there might be more non-Islamic countries too right? Example: Chinese Muslims"
120,It is not official but one can easily infer from the statements of HM that CAA addresses partition. And Afghanistan is included because many families migrated to Afghanistan from Pakistan at that time as it wasn't the hell it is now.
121,Calling the NPR and the census the same thing is highly misleading
122,Read Again What i said Please
124,Why have any reading comprehension when pulling statements out of his ass is much easier for him. He's just another troll who appears on such threads and spews bullshit with zero sources or backing.
126,"Hey, I might sound a bit dumb, but I'm so confused now what the left and right stand for. I'm mixing this up with the European and American leftists and rightists. Could somebody explain this?"
128,"Need to share this in other subs, where people have completely spread lies"
129,Well explained facts. Thanks 🙏 for putting this. Please accept platinum.
130,Tysm!!
131,Done.. If Still you Find Any Slur Or Exclamation Please Feel Free to share
132,"Amazing, this post is perfectly written keep it up op."
134,"Great effort in collecting all the facts, they are really helpful. But, the problem is the government is fucked up in conveying what's the deal of it. Modi declines that there isn't any discussion on NRC and NPR while Amit Shah has mentioned it in almost every public meeting. If the government can write down everything what's gonna happen in NRC and NPR, what are the documents necessary to prove citizenship and print it in all the major newspapers and tv channels, it will be reassuring. The major cause of these riots is lack of proper communication between govt and people. That sucks!"
135,I Agree With You.. The Govt Isnt Handling This Spread Of Misinformation And Fear Nicely.. If They Would Have been More Careful.. This Issue Wouldnt Reach this Much Large Scale
137,Quoting this from Wikipedia The process of updating Assam's part of NRC started in 2013 when the Supreme Court of India passed an order for it to be updated. Edit: Additional Source
138,Update this.
144,I am going to bookmark this. Excellent compilation.
145,"CAA Gives Citizenship To Illegal Immigrants. I would like to correct your this statement CAA Gives Citizenship To RELIGIOUSLY PRESECUTED MINIORITIES who can be illegal immigrants.. what the term ""religiously presecuted"" does ... is that it cuts down the number by a lot.. not everyone who comes here is persecuted.. most of the people especiialy in assam are bangladeshi muslims... who are neither persecuted nor included in CAA.. So they Wont be given Citizenship .. Criteria of defining ""Religious Persecution "" is very tough.. Thanks for bringing this Up I will Add This in the Post.. And... Here's A link explaining that criteria"
146,There is no such mention anywhere on papers. NRC excluded about a million Hindus. Are you saying all of them won't get citizenship ? Is there any official documentation saying so ? Because Sonowal and Himanta have been claiming otherwise in their rallies.
148,I Dont Want Money If Still Someone Is willing to Give I would Suggest Them To donate to Bharat Ke Veer Website Or donate to That policeman's family Who lost his life in this mess🙏
156,"Bro make a doc that can be shared , people from FB , twitter. Won't come on reddit to check this. It's well done but create a link so we can share"
157,Will Try To do Soon
158,Thank you for this post... I highly appreciate it!!!!
161,"This thread is a joke, cherry picking of facts, clearly ignoring the agenda of the government that they want to Discriminate against Muslims."
162,Cherry Picking of facts Cherry picking? i would like to see the other facts clearly ignoring the agenda of the government thag they want to discriminate against muslims I would like you to read this article Plus All The Additional Benefits That i have Mentioned that Miniorities/Muslims get ...that hindus Domt
163,"Taaliyaan bajao re apne secular bhai ke liye, itna important sources backed observation leke aaye hain"
164,Used my free Reddit coins on something great.
165,Linked to Indiarwresources too.
166,"Intended audience nahi padega OP. Man bana liya, Hindu oppressor hai, aur only because of retaliation of Hindus, any and all violence by Mullas are justified."
168,"What is your stance regarding the rohingiyas? They are Muslims and were persecuted in their country. If Bangladesh closes their doors to more rohingiyas and the only option left for them is India, will the Indian government do the same? If yes, then will it not become a contradiction to the very propositions of the CAA bill, helping the persecuted?"
169,"The so called persecution occured after mutlitple provocations and attacks on various other communities, they deserved to be thrown out, some other country can have them if their heart is bleeding so much for these vermin"
170,"I have refrained from posting my personal opinion in this post.. but if u still want to hear my stance.. then acc to what i have read from here The Clashes emerged  after lots of attacks of insurgents and Islamist extremists while the burma just kept quiet until they had enough. Honestly I wouldnt Like Rohingyas to Be taken Refugees here because of their history of constant violence and pushing their idealogy on other people.. No one can guarantee they wouldnt cause same trouble here that they caused in Myanmar.. On the other hand i do believe Not everyone of those rohingyas will be this much extremist.. But you cant also  Risk the security of your people.. by taking them in.. With CAA Only Communities from Pakistan, bangladesh and Afghanistan are allowed.. They Share a lot in common with us..our cultures are almost same..it will be easy for them to adapt/settle herea and our citizens to accept them while rohingyas  on other hand doesnt share as much.."
171,If no Muslim has ever tried to take refuge from these countries what is the problem in including them? Wouldn’t the protests just stop then ? Easy peasy!
172,"They already demanded a separate country, why should we bring back the same vermin? To give them more of our land?"
173,"The “Adhaar” has covered 99% of adults in India. If Adhaar is a valid document(which is what two of the links you shared say) then how would the said illegal immigrants be identified ? The Assam NRC was a disaster, where ex Army people were also left out. How are we sure that a nation wide NRC would not be faulty ? The error rate of Adhaar itself was around 9%. Going into the economics of this, how can we prove that this exercise would solve any problem ? The cost of the Assam NRC was a whopping 1200 crores. Scale that to the entire country which is around 40 times the size of Assam, it would cost 48000 crores ! India’s current GDP output is 2.6 lakh crores. Why are we wasting so much money just to identify 3 crore illegal immigrants ?"
180,Whle youre average person wont be affected I would argue that people living in abject poverty and are homeless wouldnt be able to provide proof. Also some muslim minorities are opressed in pakistan
181,This pic is a slap to all those dhimmis that are screaming that CAA is discriminatory. https://m.imgur.com/a/J5ELrYd
182,thanks so much for dropping all this information in one post!
184,"Your efforts are appreciated, i do have one point- the information in this entire writeup is very fact oriented, except by the end, where it explicitly links to media which could be easily brushed off as propaganda. I feel the inclusion the last part is unnecessary as, it can be easily labelled as propaganda, while by end of the writeup one can reach the said conclusions without the words explicitly saying it. Id also like to know what you have to say about about posting the same writeup on the other sub which dosnt seem to tolerate anything pro-caa."
185,"Thanks For Appreciating.. Yes I think last part can be brushed off as propaganda.. i intend to add more things.. cover both sides more .. Yes By the end One could Reach conclusion that whether this whole CAA-NRC-NPR is good/bad.. But i wanted to show more things that why this matter have gained soo much importance.. why these protests have been dragged so much.. Well I cant Post this to that ""other sub"" Which doesnt tolerate anything pro-CAA coz last time when i tried to spoke or present facts.. I got Banned .."
186,eye opening
187,"Doing god's work brother. It's such an irony how readily we Indians can compromise our own dignity. History is the proof, when we allowed foreign rulers to take over."
190,"What is your government's policy about the children born to these illegal immigrants? Will they be deported as well or allowed citizenship? If they are allowed citizenship, how will the government tackle the separation problem (like the one most recently experienced in the US)? I'm asking too many questions but will be glad to hear both sides of the story. And this problem has many similarities with the Afghan refugee crisis in Pakistan. I'm at least in favour of letting those born inside the country getting citizenship but don't know how to solve the separation problem."
191,"First of all the protesting is not wrong. Anyone can protest for anything and that is their basic right. The protests started as a peaceful protest and somehow changed to violent ones. YOU HAVE NO PROOF HOW. People are dying and country is in shambles. Secondly, if India wants to ""PROTECT"" those people in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan by giving them citizenship then why to exclude Muslims from it? They can anyway give citizenship to those people who are oppressed. Why do you want to publicly announce that 'oh look we will EXCLUDE Muslims out of it' just fucking go ahead an do it.. who is stopping you? These are all methods of polarization and unwise people like most of the people on this subreddit don't realize this. Apna opinion apney gaand mein daalna when your kids wouldn't have jobs."
192,"First of all the protesting is not wrong When did i said it is? YOU HAVE NO PROOF HOW of what? how protest turned violent? why exclude Muslims from it? coz they are neither opressed nor persecuted nor a Miniority. Please first read the whole post .. Why Do You want To Publicly Annouce that 'oh Look we exclude muslims out of it' Man, i Have got to know the limits of dumbness someone can acheive by reading your this line.. seriously DO U EVEN KNOW WHY ARE PEOPLE PROTESTING? COZ OF THIS MAIN REASON! Apna Opinion  Apni Gand Me daalna Didnt shared any of my opinion in whole post.. everything is backed with sources except the last part where i talk abt spread of misinformation.. and about gand me daalna thing.. bhai apne kinks apne pass hi rakh.."
193,"Thank you though I am not pro-nationwide NRC still I appreciate that it has been clarified that what these actually are. It's pretty well maintained also, please add the points about CAA that what are the documents required for it."
194,I have added the criteria for CAA.. Please read Carefully!🙏
195,"Oh, I missed that part my bad, but it's pretty well written and I wish it could be posted in the other sub too, but *sigh* More people need to be educated about this, don't you think the government should have declared proper clarification regarding this?"
196,Just one question.. Why did our hm says here that Aadhar PAN voter id Passport Not a proof of citizenship.. https://youtu.be/g4dKDQKQGjg I rest my case...
197,I dont think anywhere in this post i have made a statement on documents based on our hm i have provided the links of the sources.. and i have mentioned which documents are required on basis of those sources..
198,"You've clearly mentioned under the heading ""How can you prove you identity"" that these documents are a proof of citizenship whereas our home minister clearly is denying them to be a valid proof of one's citizenship. Furthermore thats the reason of the protest that the govt isn't giving a clear answer regarding NRC & NPR"
200,Fuck yeah. ABout time this shit is widely circulated to e-slap those folks who are screaming 'discrimination'! Secularism in India is a one way street.
201,Thank you for spreading the true facts instead of the bs that the India subreddit and news media are spreading! Modi Zinda Badd!

205,lol how i am biased?
206,"Add a strong point to the - 'secular fabric of India':- As Affirmative Action aka reservation is based on the criteria of religion, caste and tribe, as people were oppressed on these very criteria, in the same manner CAA is using religion, as it's the very criteria of oppression in neighbouring countries. If laws like reservation don't disrupt the secularity of India, despite the fact of it being based on the differentiation by caste, creed and religion, then CAA also don't disrupt the secular fabric of India Also OP don't mention any points on NRC and NPR as there are no formal drafts for it, and the points sounds less authentic without it. Edit 1:- Also OP mention a similar act passed in the US Congress without any upheaval:- The Religious Persecution Relief Act, 2016 of the United States declares, ""Syrian nationals who are religious minorities in their country of origin: shall be classified as refugees of special humanitarian concern, shall be eligible for priority two processing under the refugee resettlement priority system..."" https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2708 https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s2708/summary"
207,Thanks For Sharing i will look into it
209,All the links for the reason for decline talk about Pakistan. What about the other nations? Could you also post reasons with proof for decline in the other nations ?
210,As I Said in Edit.. I am updating this post its still not complete yet.. i will add everything..
211,"That was not fake news about the hoisting of the flag on the mosque. Here is a link The thing is the pro side will believe opindia and the anti side will believe altnews, I would rather suggest you to remove that information or add both links and let people decide."
214,"To begin with, I don't think a group which consists of 15% of the population should get a minority status, but that is digressing from the discussion. For Pakistan, there is no difference between an Ahmedia and a Hindu, they are the same. Religious minority(they are less than 5%, most of them Hindus if I'm not mistaken). Your example is flawed, since Shaivites are still Hindus, not a different religious group. So if their documents don't mention Ahmedis, then they won't mention Hindu (they technically shouldn't but I haven't confirmed this)"
